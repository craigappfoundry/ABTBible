# The Third General Epistle of John

## Chapter 1

**<sup>1</sup>** The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.

**<sup>2</sup>** Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in good health, just as your soul prospers. **<sup>3</sup>** For I rejoiced greatly when brothers came and testified to your truth, just as you are walking in the truth. **<sup>4</sup>** I have no greater joy than this: to hear that my children are walking in the truth.

**<sup>5</sup>** Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you do for the brothers, even though they are strangers. **<sup>6</sup>** They have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God, **<sup>7</sup>** because they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles. **<sup>8</sup>** Therefore we ought to support such men, so that we may be fellow workers for the truth.

**<sup>9</sup>** I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept us. **<sup>10</sup>** Because of this, if I come, I will bring up what he is doing, slandering us with wicked words. And not being satisfied with that, he not only refuses to welcome the brothers himself but also hinders those who want to do so and puts them out of the church.

**<sup>11</sup>** Beloved, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. The one who does good is from God; the one who does evil has not seen God. **<sup>12</sup>** Demetrius has been well spoken of by everyone, and by the truth itself. And we also speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is true.

**<sup>13</sup>** I had many things to write to you, but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink. **<sup>14</sup>** But I hope to see you soon, and we will speak face to face.

**<sup>15</sup>** Peace to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
