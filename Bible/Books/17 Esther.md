# The Book of Esther

## Chapter 1

**<sup>1</sup>** Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus—the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Cush over one hundred twenty-seven provinces— **<sup>2</sup>** in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on the royal throne in the citadel of Susa, **<sup>3</sup>** in the third year of his reign he gave a feast for all his officials and servants. The army of Persia and Media, the nobles and governors of the provinces were before him, **<sup>4</sup>** while he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendor of his majestic greatness for many days, one hundred eighty days in all.

**<sup>5</sup>** When these days were completed, the king made a feast lasting seven days for all the people present in the citadel of Susa, both great and small, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace. **<sup>6</sup>** There were white and blue curtains fastened with cords of fine linen and purple on silver rods and marble pillars, and couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of alabaster, marble, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones. **<sup>7</sup>** Drinks were served in golden vessels, each vessel different from the other, and royal wine was abundant according to the bounty of the king. **<sup>8</sup>** The drinking was done according to the law: none was compelled, for the king had instructed all the stewards of his household to do according to each man’s pleasure.

**<sup>9</sup>** Queen Vashti also made a feast for the women in the royal house that belonged to King Ahasuerus.

**<sup>10</sup>** On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus, **<sup>11</sup>** to bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown, to show the people and the officials her beauty, for she was very beautiful. **<sup>12</sup>** But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command delivered by the eunuchs. Then the king was very angry, and his wrath burned within him.

**<sup>13</sup>** Then the king said to the wise men who knew the times (for this was the king’s custom toward all who knew law and judgment— **<sup>14</sup>** those nearest him being Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media who saw the king’s face and sat first in the kingdom): **<sup>15</sup>** “According to the law, what is to be done to Queen Vashti because she did not perform the command of King Ahasuerus delivered by the eunuchs?” **<sup>16</sup>** Then Memucan said in the presence of the king and the princes, “Queen Vashti has done wrong not only against the king but also against all the princes and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. **<sup>17</sup>** For the deed of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to look with contempt on their husbands as they say, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she did not come.’ **<sup>18</sup>** This very day the noble women of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s act will speak in the same way to all the king’s princes, and there will be no end of contempt and wrath.

**<sup>19</sup>** If it please the king, let a royal decree go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of Persia and Media so that it cannot be revoked, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus, and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she. **<sup>20</sup>** So when the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom, vast as it is, all women will give honor to their husbands, both great and small.”

**<sup>21</sup>** The word pleased the king and the princes, and the king did as Memucan had proposed. **<sup>22</sup>** He sent letters to all the provinces of the king, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language, that every man should be master in his own house and speak in the language of his own people. 

## Chapter 2

**<sup>1</sup>** After these things, when the anger of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her. **<sup>2</sup>** Then the king’s young attendants who served him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king, **<sup>3</sup>** and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the harem under the custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who is in charge of the women. Let their cosmetics be given to them, **<sup>4</sup>** and let the young woman who pleases the king become queen instead of Vashti.” The matter pleased the king, and he did so.

**<sup>5</sup>** Now there was a Jew in the citadel of Susa whose name was Mordecai son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjaminite, **<sup>6</sup>** who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the exiles who were taken into captivity with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away. **<sup>7</sup>** He was bringing up Hadassah, that is, Esther, the daughter of his uncle, for she had neither father nor mother. The young woman was beautiful in form and appearance, and when her father and mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter.

**<sup>8</sup>** So when the king’s command and decree were proclaimed and many young women were gathered in the citadel of Susa under the custody of Hegai, Esther also was taken to the king’s palace into the custody of Hegai, who was in charge of the women. **<sup>9</sup>** The young woman pleased him and found favor with him, and he quickly provided her with her cosmetics and her portion of food, and with seven chosen young women from the king’s palace. He advanced her and her maids to the best place in the harem. **<sup>10</sup>** Esther had not made known her people or her kindred, for Mordecai had instructed her not to make it known. **<sup>11</sup>** And every day Mordecai walked in front of the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and what was happening to her.

**<sup>12</sup>** Now when the turn came for each young woman to go in to King Ahasuerus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women—for this was the regular period of their beautification, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics for women— **<sup>13</sup>** when the young woman went in to the king in this way, she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the harem to the king’s house. **<sup>14</sup>** In the evening she would go in, and in the morning she would return to the second harem under the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not go in to the king again unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.

**<sup>15</sup>** When the turn came for Esther, the daughter of Abihail, the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his own daughter, to go in to the king, she requested nothing except what Hegai, the king’s eunuch who had charge of the women, advised. And Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her. **<sup>16</sup>** Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal palace in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. **<sup>17</sup>** And the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. **<sup>18</sup>** Then the king gave a great feast for all his princes and his servants: it was Esther’s feast. He also granted a remission of taxes to the provinces and gave gifts according to the bounty of the king.

**<sup>19</sup>** When the virgins were gathered the second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate. **<sup>20</sup>** Esther had not made known her kindred or her people, as Mordecai had instructed her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai just as when she was brought up by him. **<sup>21</sup>** In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the doorway, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. **<sup>22</sup>** But the matter became known to Mordecai, and he told Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in Mordecai’s name. **<sup>23</sup>** When the matter was investigated and found to be so, the men were both hanged on a gallows, and it was recorded in the Book of the Chronicles in the presence of the king. 

## Chapter 3

**<sup>1</sup>** After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite and advanced him and set his throne above all the officials who were with him. **<sup>2</sup>** And all the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage. **<sup>3</sup>** Then the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate said to Mordecai, “Why are you transgressing the king’s command?” **<sup>4</sup>** And when they spoke to him day after day and he did not listen to them, they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s words would stand, for he had told them that he was a Jew. **<sup>5</sup>** When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage to him, Haman was filled with fury. **<sup>6</sup>** But he thought it beneath him to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai. So Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.

**<sup>7</sup>** In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, they cast lots) before Haman day after day to find the right day and month. The lot fell on the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. **<sup>8</sup>** Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered and separated among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom. Their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king’s laws, so it is not in the king’s interest to let them remain. **<sup>9</sup>** If it pleases the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who carry out the king’s business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.”

**<sup>10</sup>** So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. **<sup>11</sup>** And the king said to Haman, “The silver is given to you, and the people also, to do with them as seems good to you.”

**<sup>12</sup>** Then the king’s scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict was written according to all that Haman commanded—to the king’s satraps, to the governors over every province, and to the officials of every people, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king’s signet ring. **<sup>13</sup>** Letters were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces to destroy, kill, and annihilate all Jews, young and old, little children and women, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods. **<sup>14</sup>** A copy of the written decree was to be issued as law in every province and made known to all peoples so that they would be ready for that day. **<sup>15</sup>** The couriers went out hurriedly by order of the king, and the decree was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was thrown into confusion. 

## Chapter 4

**<sup>1</sup>** When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, crying out with a loud and bitter cry. **<sup>2</sup>** He went up to the entrance of the king’s gate, for no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter the king’s gate. **<sup>3</sup>** And in every province, wherever the king’s command and his decree reached, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and lamenting, and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.

**<sup>4</sup>** When Esther’s maids and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was greatly distressed. She sent garments to clothe Mordecai, so that he might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them. **<sup>5</sup>** Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was happening. **<sup>6</sup>** So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king’s gate. **<sup>7</sup>** And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews. **<sup>8</sup>** He also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her, and to charge her to go to the king to beg his favor and plead with him on behalf of her people.

**<sup>9</sup>** Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said. **<sup>10</sup>** Then Esther spoke to Hathach and commanded him to go to Mordecai, **<sup>11</sup>** “All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is but one law—to put him to death—except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter that he may live. But I have not been called to come to the king for thirty days.”

**<sup>12</sup>** And they told Mordecai what Esther had said. **<sup>13</sup>** Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, “Do not think in your heart that you will escape in the king’s house any more than all the Jews. **<sup>14</sup>** For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. And who knows whether you have come to royal position for such a time as this?”

**<sup>15</sup>** Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai, **<sup>16</sup>** “Go, gather all the Jews who are found in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids also will fast in the same way. Then I will go to the king, though it is against the law, and if I perish, I perish.” **<sup>17</sup>** So Mordecai went and did everything that Esther had commanded him. 

## Chapter 5

**<sup>1</sup>** On the third day Esther put on her royal garments and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, opposite the king’s hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne inside the hall, opposite the entrance. **<sup>2</sup>** When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she found favor in his sight, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter. **<sup>3</sup>** Then the king said to her, “What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to half of the kingdom.” **<sup>4</sup>** And Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to a banquet that I have prepared for him.” **<sup>5</sup>** Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly, so that we may do as Esther has said.” So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.

**<sup>6</sup>** And as they were drinking wine at the banquet, the king said to Esther, “What is your petition? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom, it shall be done.” **<sup>7</sup>** Then Esther answered, “My petition and my request is this: **<sup>8</sup>** If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them tomorrow, and then I will do as the king has said.”

**<sup>9</sup>** Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai at the king’s gate, that he neither rose nor trembled before him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai. **<sup>10</sup>** Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home. And he sent and brought his friends and his wife Zeresh. **<sup>11</sup>** And Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the number of his sons, and all the ways the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the officials and the servants of the king. **<sup>12</sup>** And Haman said, “Even Queen Esther let no one come with the king to the banquet she prepared but me, and tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king. **<sup>13</sup>** Yet all this is worth nothing to me so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.” **<sup>14</sup>** Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Let a gallows fifty cubits high be made, and in the morning tell the king to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go joyfully with the king to the banquet.” The advice pleased Haman, and he had the gallows made. 

## Chapter 6

**<sup>1</sup>** That night the king could not sleep, so he commanded that the book of the records, the chronicles, be brought, and they were read before the king. **<sup>2</sup>** And it was found written how Mordecai had reported about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the doorway, who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. **<sup>3</sup>** And the king said, “What honor or dignity has been done for Mordecai because of this?” Then the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.”

**<sup>4</sup>** And the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s house to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. **<sup>5</sup>** The king’s servants said to him, “Haman is standing in the court.” And the king said, “Let him come in.” **<sup>6</sup>** So Haman came in, and the king said to him, “What should be done for the man whom the king delights to honor?” Now Haman said to himself, “Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?” **<sup>7</sup>** So Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king delights to honor, **<sup>8</sup>** let royal garments be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse on which the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown has been set. **<sup>9</sup>** And let the garments and the horse be delivered into the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes. Let them array the man whom the king delights to honor, and lead him on horseback through the open square of the city, proclaiming before him, ‘Thus shall it be done for the man whom the king delights to honor!’”

**<sup>10</sup>** Then the king said to Haman, “Hurry, take the garments and the horse, as you have said, and do so for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s gate. Do not leave out anything that you have mentioned.” **<sup>11</sup>** So Haman took the garments and the horse, and he clothed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the open square of the city, proclaiming before him, “Thus shall it be done for the man whom the king delights to honor!”

**<sup>12</sup>** Then Mordecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered. **<sup>13</sup>** And Haman recounted to his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the seed of the Jews, you will not overcome him but will surely fall before him.”

**<sup>14</sup>** While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 

## Chapter 7

**<sup>1</sup>** So the king and Haman came to drink with Queen Esther. **<sup>2</sup>** And on the second day, as they were drinking wine, the king said again to Esther, “What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to half of the kingdom, it shall be done.”

**<sup>3</sup>** Then Queen Esther answered, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request. **<sup>4</sup>** For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as male and female slaves, I would have remained silent, for our distress is not to be compared with the loss to the king.”

**<sup>5</sup>** Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, who has dared to do this?” **<sup>6</sup>** And Esther said, “The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.” Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen.

**<sup>7</sup>** The king arose in his wrath from the wine-drinking and went into the palace garden, but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm was determined against him by the king. **<sup>8</sup>** When the king returned from the palace garden to the place where they were drinking wine, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. And the king said, “Will he even assault the queen while I am in the house?” As the words left the mouth of the king, they covered Haman’s face. **<sup>9</sup>** Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, said, “Look! The gallows that Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, stands at Haman’s house, fifty cubits high.” And the king said, “Hang him on it.” **<sup>10</sup>** So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s wrath subsided. 

## Chapter 8

**<sup>1</sup>** On that day King Ahasuerus gave to Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was to her. **<sup>2</sup>** And the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.

**<sup>3</sup>** Then Esther spoke again before the king. She fell at his feet and wept and pleaded with him to avert the evil plan of Haman the Agagite and the scheme that he had devised against the Jews. **<sup>4</sup>** The king held out the golden scepter to Esther, and Esther rose and stood before the king. **<sup>5</sup>** She said, “If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor before him, and if the matter seems right before the king and I am pleasing in his sight, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the provinces of the king. **<sup>6</sup>** For how can I bear to see the calamity that will come upon my people? And how can I bear to see the destruction of my kindred?”

**<sup>7</sup>** Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “See, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he stretched out his hand against the Jews. **<sup>8</sup>** Now you may write as you please concerning the Jews, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s signet ring; for a decree that is written in the name of the king and sealed with the king’s signet ring cannot be revoked.”

**<sup>9</sup>** The king’s scribes were summoned at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day, and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded concerning the Jews, to the satraps and the governors and the princes of the provinces which extended from India to Cush, one hundred twenty-seven provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, and also to the Jews in their script and language. **<sup>10</sup>** He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed it with the king’s signet ring, and sent letters by mounted couriers riding on swift horses bred from the royal studs. **<sup>11</sup>** In them the king granted the Jews who were in every city the right to gather and defend their lives, to destroy, to slay, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them, their children, and their women, and to plunder their goods, **<sup>12</sup>** on one day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. **<sup>13</sup>** A copy of what was written was to be issued as a decree in every province, made known to all peoples, and that the Jews should be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. **<sup>14</sup>** So the couriers, mounted on the royal horses, went out hurriedly, pressed by the king’s command, and the decree was issued in Susa the citadel.

**<sup>15</sup>** Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal robes of blue and white, with a great crown of gold and a mantle of fine linen and purple, and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced. **<sup>16</sup>** For the Jews there was light and gladness and joy and honor. **<sup>17</sup>** And in every province and in every city, wherever the king’s command and his decree came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many from among the peoples of the land declared themselves Jews, for the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them. 

## Chapter 9

**<sup>1</sup>** Now in the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s command and his decree were about to be carried out, on the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain power over them, it was turned to the contrary, so that the Jews gained power over those who hated them. **<sup>2</sup>** The Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm, and no one could stand against them, for the fear of them had fallen on all the peoples. **<sup>3</sup>** And all the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those who did the king’s work helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them. **<sup>4</sup>** For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater.

**<sup>5</sup>** So the Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and did as they pleased to those who hated them. **<sup>6</sup>** In Susa the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men, **<sup>7</sup>** and also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, **<sup>8</sup>** Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, **<sup>9</sup>** Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, **<sup>10</sup>** the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.

**<sup>11</sup>** That day the number of those killed in Susa the citadel was reported to the king. **<sup>12</sup>** And the king said to Queen Esther, “In Susa the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you. And what further request do you have? It shall be done.” **<sup>13</sup>** Then Esther said, “If it please the king, let the Jews who are in Susa be allowed tomorrow also to do according to this day’s decree, and let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the gallows.” **<sup>14</sup>** So the king commanded that this be done; a decree was issued in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged. **<sup>15</sup>** The Jews who were in Susa gathered again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred men in Susa, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.

**<sup>16</sup>** Now the rest of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces also gathered to defend their lives and had rest from their enemies, killing seventy-five thousand of those who hated them, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder. **<sup>17</sup>** This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness. **<sup>18</sup>** But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth day and on the fourteenth, and rested on the fifteenth day, making it a day of feasting and gladness. **<sup>19</sup>** Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month of Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a good day, and of sending portions to one another.

**<sup>20</sup>** Mordecai recorded these things and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, **<sup>21</sup>** obliging them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and also the fifteenth day of the same, year by year, **<sup>22</sup>** as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and as the month that had been turned for them from sorrow to gladness and from mourning to a good day, that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, of sending portions to one another and gifts to the poor. **<sup>23</sup>** So the Jews accepted what they had begun to do, and what Mordecai had written to them.

**<sup>24</sup>** For Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to crush and to destroy them. **<sup>25</sup>** But when it came before the king, he commanded by letter that his wicked plot which he had devised against the Jews should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. **<sup>26</sup>** Therefore they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Therefore, because of all the words of this letter, and of what they had seen concerning this matter and what had happened to them, **<sup>27</sup>** the Jews established and accepted as a custom for themselves and for their descendants and for all who joined them, that without fail they would keep these two days according to what was written and at their appointed time every year, **<sup>28</sup>** that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city, and that these days of Purim should not fail among the Jews, nor should their remembrance perish from their descendants.

**<sup>29</sup>** Then Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim. **<sup>30</sup>** He sent letters to all the Jews, to the one hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth, **<sup>31</sup>** to confirm these days of Purim at their appointed times, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established for them, and as they had established for themselves and for their descendants concerning their fasts and their lamenting. **<sup>32</sup>** And the command of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim, and it was written in the book. 

## Chapter 10

**<sup>1</sup>** King Ahasuerus imposed tribute on the land and on the coastlands of the sea. **<sup>2</sup>** And all the acts of his power and his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? **<sup>3</sup>** For Mordecai the Jew was second to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of his brothers, seeking the good of his people and speaking peace to all his descendants.
