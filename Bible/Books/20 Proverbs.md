# The Proverbs

## Chapter 1

**<sup>1</sup>** The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:

**<sup>2</sup>** To know wisdom and instruction, to discern the sayings of understanding, **<sup>3</sup>** to receive instruction in wise behavior, righteousness, justice, and integrity, **<sup>4</sup>** to give prudence to the naïve, knowledge and discretion to the youth— **<sup>5</sup>** let the wise man hear and increase in learning, and let the man of understanding acquire guidance— **<sup>6</sup>** to understand a proverb and a figure, the words of the wise and their riddles.

**<sup>7</sup>** The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.

**<sup>8</sup>** Hear, my son, your father’s instruction, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching, **<sup>9</sup>** for they are a garland of grace on your head and necklaces about your neck.

**<sup>10</sup>** My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent. **<sup>11</sup>** If they say, “Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without cause; **<sup>12</sup>** let us swallow them alive like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit; **<sup>13</sup>** we will find all sorts of precious possessions, we will fill our houses with spoil; **<sup>14</sup>** cast your lot among us; let us all have one purse”— **<sup>15</sup>** my son, do not walk in the way with them; restrain your foot from their path, **<sup>16</sup>** for their feet run to evil, and they hasten to shed blood.

**<sup>17</sup>** Surely, in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird, **<sup>18</sup>** but they lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own lives. **<sup>19</sup>** Such are the ways of everyone who gains by violence; it takes away the life of its possessors.

**<sup>20</sup>** Wisdom cries out in the street; she lifts her voice in the public square. **<sup>21</sup>** At the head of the noisy streets she calls out; at the entrances of the gates in the city she utters her sayings: **<sup>22</sup>** “How long, O naïve ones, will you love simplicity? And how long will scoffers delight in their scoffing, and fools hate knowledge? **<sup>23</sup>** Turn at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.

**<sup>24</sup>** Because I called and you refused, I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention, **<sup>25</sup>** and you neglected all my counsel and did not want my reproof, **<sup>26</sup>** I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your dread comes, **<sup>27</sup>** when your dread comes like a storm, and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.

**<sup>28</sup>** Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently, but will not find me. **<sup>29</sup>** Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD, **<sup>30</sup>** they would not accept my counsel; they spurned all my reproof— **<sup>31</sup>** so they shall eat the fruit of their way and be filled with their own devices. **<sup>32</sup>** For the waywardness of the naïve will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them. **<sup>33</sup>** But he who listens to me will dwell securely and will be at ease, without dread of evil. 

## Chapter 2

**<sup>1</sup>** My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments within you, **<sup>2</sup>** making your ear attentive to wisdom, inclining your heart to understanding, **<sup>3</sup>** yes, if you call out for discernment, raise your voice for understanding.

**<sup>4</sup>** If you seek her like silver and search for her as for hidden treasures, **<sup>5</sup>** then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.

**<sup>6</sup>** For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding; **<sup>7</sup>** He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk in integrity, **<sup>8</sup>** guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of His saints.

**<sup>9</sup>** Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity—every good path; **<sup>10</sup>** for wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul; **<sup>11</sup>** discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you.

**<sup>12</sup>** It will deliver you from the way of evil, from men who speak perverse things, **<sup>13</sup>** who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness, **<sup>14</sup>** who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perversity of the wicked, **<sup>15</sup>** whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways;

**<sup>16</sup>** Stay away from the strange woman, from the foreign woman with her smooth words, **<sup>17</sup>** who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God; **<sup>18</sup>** for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed. **<sup>19</sup>** None who go to her return, nor do they attain the paths of life.

**<sup>20</sup>** So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous. **<sup>21</sup>** For the upright will dwell in the land, and the blameless will remain in it; **<sup>22</sup>** but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be uprooted from it. 

## Chapter 3

**<sup>1</sup>** My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments, **<sup>2</sup>** for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you.

**<sup>3</sup>** Do not let kindness and truth forsake you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart, **<sup>4</sup>** so you will find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.

**<sup>5</sup>** Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. **<sup>6</sup>** In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight. **<sup>7</sup>** Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and turn away from evil. **<sup>8</sup>** It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones.

**<sup>9</sup>** Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce, **<sup>10</sup>** then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine.

**<sup>11</sup>** My son, do not despise the discipline of the LORD, and do not loathe His reproof, **<sup>12</sup>** for the LORD loves those whom He reproves, as a father the son in whom he delights.

**<sup>13</sup>** Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gains understanding, **<sup>14</sup>** for her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her yield than fine gold. **<sup>15</sup>** She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her. **<sup>16</sup>** Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. **<sup>17</sup>** Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. **<sup>18</sup>** She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed.

**<sup>19</sup>** The LORD founded the earth by wisdom; He established the heavens by understanding. **<sup>20</sup>** By His knowledge the deeps were split, and the clouds produce dew.

**<sup>21</sup>** My son, do not let them escape from your sight; keep sound wisdom and discretion, **<sup>22</sup>** and they will be life to your soul and adornment to your neck. **<sup>23</sup>** Then you will walk securely on your way, and your foot will not stumble. **<sup>24</sup>** If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet. **<sup>25</sup>** Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the storm of the wicked when it comes, **<sup>26</sup>** for the LORD will be your confidence and will guard your foot from being caught.

**<sup>27</sup>** Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it. **<sup>28</sup>** Do not say to your neighbor, “Go and come again; tomorrow I will give it”—when you have it with you. **<sup>29</sup>** Do not plot harm against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you. **<sup>30</sup>** Do not contend with a man for no reason, if he has done you no harm. **<sup>31</sup>** Do not envy a violent man, and do not choose any of his ways, **<sup>32</sup>** for the devious man is an abomination to the LORD, but His secret counsel is with the upright.

**<sup>33</sup>** The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked, but He blesses the dwelling of the righteous. **<sup>34</sup>** He mocks the mockers, but gives grace to the humble. **<sup>35</sup>** The wise will inherit honor, but fools display dishonor. 

## Chapter 4

**<sup>1</sup>** Hear, O sons, the instruction of a father, and pay attention, that you may gain understanding, **<sup>2</sup>** for I give you good teaching; do not forsake my instruction.

**<sup>3</sup>** When I was a son to my father, tender and the only one in the sight of my mother, **<sup>4</sup>** he taught me and said to me, “Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments and live. **<sup>5</sup>** Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget and do not turn away from the words of my mouth. **<sup>6</sup>** Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you.

**<sup>7</sup>** The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and with all your ability, get understanding. **<sup>8</sup>** Prize her, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her. **<sup>9</sup>** She will place on your head a garland of grace; she will bestow on you a crown of beauty.”

**<sup>10</sup>** Hear, my son, and receive my words, and the years of your life will be many. **<sup>11</sup>** I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in paths of uprightness. **<sup>12</sup>** When you walk, your step will not be hindered, and if you run, you will not stumble. **<sup>13</sup>** Hold fast to instruction; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life.

**<sup>14</sup>** Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of evil men. **<sup>15</sup>** Avoid it; do not pass by it; turn away from it and pass on. **<sup>16</sup>** For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. **<sup>17</sup>** For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.

**<sup>18</sup>** The road the righteous travel is like the light of dawn, shining brighter and brighter until full day. **<sup>19</sup>** The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what they stumble over.

**<sup>20</sup>** My son, pay attention to my words; incline your ear to my sayings. **<sup>21</sup>** Do not let them depart from your eyes; keep them in the midst of your heart. **<sup>22</sup>** For they are life to those who find them and healing to all their flesh.

**<sup>23</sup>** Guard your heart with all diligence, for from it flow the springs of life. **<sup>24</sup>** Put away from yourself crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you. **<sup>25</sup>** Let your eyes look directly ahead, and let your gaze be straight before you. **<sup>26</sup>** Make the path of your foot level, and all your ways will be established. **<sup>27</sup>** Do not turn to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil. 

## Chapter 5

**<sup>1</sup>** My son, pay attention to my wisdom; incline your ear to my understanding, **<sup>2</sup>** that you may guard discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.

**<sup>3</sup>** For the lips of the strange woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil, **<sup>4</sup>** but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a double-edged sword. **<sup>5</sup>** Her feet go down to death; her steps lay hold of the grave. **<sup>6</sup>** She does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it.

**<sup>7</sup>** Now then, my sons, listen to me, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth. **<sup>8</sup>** Keep your path far from her, and do not go near the door of her house, **<sup>9</sup>** lest you give your vigor to others and your years to the cruel one; **<sup>10</sup>** lest strangers be filled with your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner, **<sup>11</sup>** and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and your body are consumed, **<sup>12</sup>** and you say, “How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof! **<sup>13</sup>** I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors. **<sup>14</sup>** I was almost in utter ruin in the midst of the assembly and congregation.”

**<sup>15</sup>** Drink water from your own cistern, and running water from your own well. **<sup>16</sup>** Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets? **<sup>17</sup>** Let them be yours alone and not for strangers with you. **<sup>18</sup>** Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth, **<sup>19</sup>** a loving doe, a graceful gazelle—let her breasts satisfy you at all times; be intoxicated always in her love. **<sup>20</sup>** Why, my son, should you be intoxicated with a strange woman and embrace the bosom of a foreigner?

**<sup>21</sup>** For the ways of a man are before the eyes of the LORD, and He watches all his paths. **<sup>22</sup>** The iniquities of the wicked will ensnare him, and he will be held fast in the cords of his sin. **<sup>23</sup>** He will die for lack of discipline, and in the greatness of his folly he will go astray. 

## Chapter 6

**<sup>1</sup>** My son, if you have become surety for your neighbor, if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger, **<sup>2</sup>** if you are snared by the words of your mouth, caught by the words of your mouth, **<sup>3</sup>** then do this, my son, and deliver yourself, for you have come into the hand of your neighbor:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, humble yourself, and urge your neighbor;<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.

**<sup>5</sup>** Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, and like a bird from the hand of the fowler. **<sup>6</sup>** Go to the ant, O sluggard; observe her ways and be wise, **<sup>7</sup>** who, having no chief, officer, or ruler, **<sup>8</sup>** prepares her food in the summer and gathers her provision in the harvest. **<sup>9</sup>** How long will you lie down, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep? **<sup>10</sup>** “A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,” **<sup>11</sup>** and your poverty will come like a prowler, and your want like an armed man.

**<sup>12</sup>** A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth, **<sup>13</sup>** winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, signaling with his fingers; **<sup>14</sup>** perversity is in his heart; he continually devises evil; he spreads strife. **<sup>15</sup>** Therefore his calamity will come suddenly; in a moment he will be broken without remedy.

**<sup>16</sup>** There are six things that the LORD hates, even seven that are an abomination to Him: **<sup>17</sup>** haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, **<sup>18</sup>** a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run swiftly to evil, **<sup>19</sup>** a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who spreads strife among brothers.

**<sup>20</sup>** My son, keep your father’s commandment, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching. **<sup>21</sup>** Bind them continually on your heart; tie them around your neck. **<sup>22</sup>** When you walk, it will lead you; when you lie down, it will watch over you; and when you awake, it will speak with you. **<sup>23</sup>** For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life, **<sup>24</sup>** to keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the foreign woman.

**<sup>25</sup>** Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelids. **<sup>26</sup>** For on account of a prostitute one is reduced to a loaf of bread, and a man’s wife hunts down a precious life. **<sup>27</sup>** Can a man carry fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? **<sup>28</sup>** Or can a man walk on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched? **<sup>29</sup>** So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife; whoever touches her will not go unpunished.

**<sup>30</sup>** People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry; **<sup>31</sup>** but if he is found, he must repay sevenfold; he must give all the substance of his house. **<sup>32</sup>** He who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself. **<sup>33</sup>** Wounds and dishonor he will get, and his reproach will not be wiped away. **<sup>34</sup>** For jealousy enrages a man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance; **<sup>35</sup>** he will not accept any ransom, nor will he be appeased though you multiply gifts. 

## Chapter 7

**<sup>1</sup>** My son, hold fast to my words and store up my commands within you. **<sup>2</sup>** Keep my commands so that you may live, and treasure my teaching like the gem of your eye. **<sup>3</sup>** Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. **<sup>4</sup>** Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding your close companion, **<sup>5</sup>** to guard you from the adulterous woman, from the seductive stranger with her smooth words.

**<sup>6</sup>** For I looked out through the lattice of my window, **<sup>7</sup>** and I saw among the naive—I noticed among the young men—a youth lacking sense. **<sup>8</sup>** He was passing along the street near her corner, walking toward her house, **<sup>9</sup>** in the twilight, as evening fell, in the dark of night and shadows. **<sup>10</sup>** Then a woman came toward him, dressed like a prostitute, with a cunning heart. **<sup>11</sup>** She was loud and defiant; her feet never stayed at home. **<sup>12</sup>** Now in the street, now in the squares, she lurked at every corner. **<sup>13</sup>** She grabbed him and kissed him; with a brazen face, she said to him, **<sup>14</sup>** “I had to offer peace offerings; today I fulfilled my vows. **<sup>15</sup>** That’s why I came out to meet you, to seek you eagerly—and I’ve found you! **<sup>16</sup>** I’ve spread my bed with coverings, with colored linens from Egypt. **<sup>17</sup>** I’ve perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. **<sup>18</sup>** Come, let’s drink deeply of love until morning; let’s delight ourselves with passion. **<sup>19</sup>** For my husband isn’t home; he’s gone on a long journey. **<sup>20</sup>** He took a bag of money with him; he won’t return until the full moon.”

**<sup>21</sup>** With her many persuasions, she seduced him; with her smooth talk, she led him astray. **<sup>22</sup>** He followed her at once, like an ox going to the slaughter, or like a stag caught in a trap, **<sup>23</sup>** until an arrow pierces its liver—like a bird rushing into a snare, unaware that it will cost him his life.

**<sup>24</sup>** Now, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to the words of my mouth. **<sup>25</sup>** Don’t let your heart turn aside to her ways; don’t stray into her paths. **<sup>26</sup>** For she has brought down many victims; her slain are a vast throng. **<sup>27</sup>** Her house is the road to the grave, descending to the chambers of death. 

## Chapter 8

**<sup>1</sup>** Does not Wisdom call out, and Understanding raise her voice? **<sup>2</sup>** On the heights, beside the road, at the crossroads she takes her stand. **<sup>3</sup>** Beside the gates, at the entrance to the city, at the access points she cries aloud: **<sup>4</sup>** “To you, O men, I call out, and my voice is to the sons of man. **<sup>5</sup>** Understand shrewdness, O simple ones; and you fools, have an understanding heart. **<sup>6</sup>** Listen, for I will speak noble things, and the opening of my lips will reveal uprightness. **<sup>7</sup>** For my mouth will utter truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. **<sup>8</sup>** All the words of my mouth are righteous; none of them are twisted or crooked. **<sup>9</sup>** They are all clear to the discerning and right to those who find knowledge. **<sup>10</sup>** Receive my instruction and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold. **<sup>11</sup>** For Wisdom is better than jewels, and all desirable things cannot compare with her.

**<sup>12</sup>** I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion. **<sup>13</sup>** The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverse speech I hate. **<sup>14</sup>** Counsel and sound wisdom are mine; I am understanding, I have might. **<sup>15</sup>** By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just. **<sup>16</sup>** By me princes govern, and nobles—all who judge rightly. **<sup>17</sup>** I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me. **<sup>18</sup>** Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness. **<sup>19</sup>** My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my yield better than choice silver. **<sup>20</sup>** I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice, **<sup>21</sup>** to give wealth to those who love me and to fill their treasuries.

**<sup>22</sup>** The Lord created me at the beginning of His way, before His deeds of old. **<sup>23</sup>** From everlasting I was established, from the beginning, from before the earth began. **<sup>24</sup>** When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no springs abounding with water. **<sup>25</sup>** Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth— **<sup>26</sup>** before He made the earth and its fields, or the first dust of the world. **<sup>27</sup>** When He established the heavens, I was there; when He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep; **<sup>28</sup>** when He made firm the skies above; when the fountains of the deep surged forth; **<sup>29</sup>** when He set limits for the sea so the waters would not transgress His command; when He marked out the foundations of the earth— **<sup>30</sup>** then I was beside Him, like a master craftsman, and I was His delight day by day, rejoicing always before Him, **<sup>31</sup>** rejoicing in the inhabited world, and delighting in the sons of man.

**<sup>32</sup>** So now, sons, listen to me: blessed are those who keep my ways. **<sup>33</sup>** Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it. **<sup>34</sup>** Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. **<sup>35</sup>** For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the Lord. **<sup>36</sup>** But he who sins against me injures his own soul; all who hate me love death. 

## Chapter 9

**<sup>1</sup>** Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out her seven pillars. **<sup>2</sup>** She has slaughtered her beasts, she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table. **<sup>3</sup>** She has sent out her maidens; she calls from the heights of the city, **<sup>4</sup>** “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” To him who lacks sense she says, **<sup>5</sup>** “Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed. **<sup>6</sup>** Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight.”

**<sup>7</sup>** He who corrects a scoffer gets abuse for himself, and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury. **<sup>8</sup>** Do not reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you. **<sup>9</sup>** Give instruction to a wise man, and he will become still wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.

**<sup>10</sup>** The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. **<sup>11</sup>** For by me your days will be multiplied, and years of life will be added to you. **<sup>12</sup>** If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; but if you scoff, you alone will bear it.

**<sup>13</sup>** The woman Folly is loud; she is seductive and knows nothing. **<sup>14</sup>** She sits at the door of her house, she takes a seat on the high places of the city, **<sup>15</sup>** calling to those who pass by, who go straight on their way, **<sup>16</sup>** “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” And to him who lacks sense she says, **<sup>17</sup>** “Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.” **<sup>18</sup>** But he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of the grave. 

## Chapter 10

**<sup>1</sup>** The proverbs of Solomon: A wise son makes a glad father,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** Treasures gained by wickedness do not profit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but righteousness delivers from death.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** The LORD does not let the righteous go hungry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but He thwarts the craving of the wicked.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** A slack hand causes poverty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the hand of the diligent makes rich.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** He who gathers in summer is a prudent son,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who brings shame.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** Blessings are on the head of the righteous,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** The memory of the righteous is a blessing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the name of the wicked will rot.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** The wise of heart will receive commandments,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a babbling fool will come to ruin.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** Whoever walks in integrity walks securely,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out.<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** Whoever winks the eye causes trouble,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a babbling fool will come to ruin.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** Hatred stirs up strife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but love covers all offenses.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** On the lips of him who has understanding, wisdom is found,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a rod is for the back of him who lacks sense.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** The wise lay up knowledge,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the mouth of a fool brings ruin near.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** The rich man’s wealth is his strong city;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the poverty of the poor is their ruin.<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** The wage of the righteous leads to life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gain of the wicked to sin.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** Whoever heeds instruction is on the path to life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who rejects reproof leads others astray.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** The one who conceals hatred has lying lips,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whoever utters slander is a fool.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** When words are many, transgression is not lacking,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but whoever restrains his lips is prudent.<br/>
**<sup>20</sup>** The tongue of the righteous is choice silver;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the heart of the wicked is of little worth.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** The lips of the righteous feed many,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but fools die for lack of sense.<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** The blessing of the LORD makes rich,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and He adds no sorrow with it.<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** Doing wrong is like a joke to a fool,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but wisdom is pleasure to a man of understanding.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** What the wicked dreads will come upon him,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the desire of the righteous will be granted.<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** When the tempest passes, the wicked is no more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the righteous is established forever.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so is the sluggard to those who send him.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** The fear of the LORD prolongs life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the years of the wicked will be short.<br/>
**<sup>28</sup>** The hope of the righteous ends in gladness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the expectation of the wicked comes to nothing.<br/>
**<sup>29</sup>** The way of the LORD is a stronghold to the upright,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but destruction to evildoers.<br/>
**<sup>30</sup>** The righteous will never be removed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the wicked will not dwell in the land.<br/>
**<sup>31</sup>** The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the perverse tongue will be cut off.<br/>
**<sup>32</sup>** The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the mouth of the wicked, what is perverse.<br/>


## Chapter 11

**<sup>1</sup>** A false balance is an abomination to the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a just weight is His delight.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** When pride comes, then comes disgrace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but with the humble is wisdom.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** The integrity of the upright guides them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them.

**<sup>4</sup>** Riches do not profit in the day of wrath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but righteousness delivers from death.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** The righteousness of the blameless makes his way straight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the wicked falls by his own wickedness.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** The righteousness of the upright delivers them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the treacherous are taken captive by their lust.

**<sup>7</sup>** When the wicked dies, his hope perishes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the expectation of strength perishes too.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** The righteous is delivered from trouble,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the wicked takes his place.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but by knowledge the righteous are delivered.

**<sup>10</sup>** When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and when the wicked perish, there is jubilation.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** Whoever belittles his neighbor lacks sense,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a man of understanding remains silent.

**<sup>13</sup>** He who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who is trustworthy in spirit keeps a matter hidden.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** Where there is no guidance, a people falls,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but in an abundance of counselors there is deliverance.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** Whoever is surety for a stranger will surely suffer harm,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who hates striking hands in pledge is secure.

**<sup>16</sup>** A gracious woman obtains honor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and violent men obtain riches.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** A man who is kind benefits himself,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a cruel man brings trouble on his own flesh.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** The wicked earns deceptive wages,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but one who sows righteousness gets a true reward.

**<sup>19</sup>** Whoever is steadfast in righteousness will live,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who pursues evil will bring about his own death.<br/>
**<sup>20</sup>** Those of crooked heart are an abomination to the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but those of blameless ways are His delight.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** Be assured, the evil man will not go unpunished,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the descendents of the righteous will be delivered.

**<sup>22</sup>** Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a beautiful woman without discretion.<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** The desire of the righteous ends only in good,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** One gives freely, yet grows all the richer;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another withholds what is right, and only suffers want.

**<sup>25</sup>** A generous soul will be enriched,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who waters will himself be watered.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** The people curse him who holds back grain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but blessing is on the head of him who sells it.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** He who diligently seeks good seeks favor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but evil comes to him who searches for it.

**<sup>28</sup>** He who trusts in his riches will fall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf.<br/>
**<sup>29</sup>** Whoever troubles his own household will inherit the wind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the fool will be servant to the wise of heart.<br/>
**<sup>30</sup>** The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who wins souls is wise.<br/>
**<sup>31</sup>** If the righteous is repaid on earth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how much more the wicked and the sinner!<br/>


## Chapter 12

**<sup>1</sup>** Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who hates reproof is stupid.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** A good man obtains favor from the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a man of wicked devices he condemns.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** A man is not established by wickedness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the root of the righteous will not be moved.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** A virtuous wife is the crown of her husband,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** The thoughts of the righteous are just,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the counsels of the wicked are deceitful.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the mouth of the upright delivers them.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** The wicked are overthrown and are no more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the house of the righteous will stand.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** A man is praised according to his insight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but one with a perverse heart will be despised.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** Better is a man who is lightly esteemed and has a servant<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than one who honors himself and lacks bread.<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** A righteous man regards the life of his animal,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the compassion of the wicked is cruel.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** He who tills his land will have plenty of bread,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who follows worthless pursuits lacks sense.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** The wicked covets the plunder of evildoers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the root of the righteous yields fruit.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** In the transgression of the lips there is a snare for the evil man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the righteous will escape from trouble.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** From the fruit of a man’s mouth he is satisfied with good,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the work of a man’s hands returns to him.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a wise man listens to counsel.<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** A fool’s vexation is known at once,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a prudent man overlooks an insult.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** He who speaks truth declares righteousness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a false witness deceit.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the tongue of the wise brings healing.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** Truthful lips endure forever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a lying tongue lasts but a moment.<br/>
**<sup>20</sup>** Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but those who plan peace have joy.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** No harm befalls the righteous,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the wicked are filled with trouble.<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but those who act faithfully are his delight.<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** A prudent man conceals knowledge,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the heart of fools proclaims folly.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** The hand of the diligent will rule,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the slothful will be put to forced labor.<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a good word makes it glad.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** The righteous chooses his friends carefully,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the way of the wicked leads them astray.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** The slothful man does not roast his prey,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the possessions of the diligent are precious.<br/>
**<sup>28</sup>** In the path of righteousness is life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in its pathway there is no death.<br/>


## Chapter 13

**<sup>1</sup>** A wise son accepts his father’s discipline,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** From the fruit of a man’s mouth he eats what is good,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the appetite of the treacherous is for violence.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** He who guards his mouth preserves his life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.

**<sup>4</sup>** The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the soul of the diligent is richly supplied.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** A righteous man hates falsehood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a wicked man brings shame and disgrace.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** Righteousness guards the way of the blameless,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but wickedness overthrows the sinner.

**<sup>7</sup>** One pretends to be rich, yet has nothing;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** The ransom of a man’s life is his wealth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a poor man hears no threat.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** The light of the righteous rejoices,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the lamp of the wicked goes out.

**<sup>10</sup>** By pride comes only strife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but with the humble is wisdom.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** Wealth gained hastily will dwindle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who gathers little by little will increase it.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** Hope deferred makes the heart sick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life.

**<sup>13</sup>** He who despises the word brings destruction on himself,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who respects the commandments will be rewarded.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to turn one away from the snares of death.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** Good sense wins favor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the way of the treacherous is their ruin.

**<sup>16</sup>** Every prudent man acts with knowledge,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a fool flaunts his folly.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** A wicked messenger falls into trouble,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a faithful envoy brings healing.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** Poverty and shame come to him who ignores instruction,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who regards reproof will be honored.

**<sup>19</sup>** A desire fulfilled is sweet to the soul,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but to turn away from evil is an abomination to fools.<br/>
**<sup>20</sup>** He who walks with the wise becomes wise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a companion of fools will suffer harm.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** Misfortune pursues sinners,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the righteous are rewarded with good.

**<sup>22</sup>** A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the sinner’s wealth is laid up for the righteous.<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** The fallow ground of the poor yields much food,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is swept away through injustice.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** He who spares the rod hates his son,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him.<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** The righteous eats to the satisfaction of his soul,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the belly of the wicked will lack.<br/>


## Chapter 14

**<sup>1</sup>** A wise woman builds her house,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the foolish tears it down with her own hands.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** He who walks in uprightness fears the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who is devious in his ways despises Him.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** In the mouth of a fool is a rod for his back,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the lips of the wise protect them.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** Where there are no oxen, the manger is clean,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but abundant harvest comes by the strength of the ox.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** A faithful witness does not lie,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a false witness breathes out lies.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** A scoffer seeks wisdom and finds none,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but knowledge comes easily to one who understands.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** Leave the presence of a foolish man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for there you do not find lips of knowledge.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the folly of fools is deceit.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** Fools mock guilt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but among the upright there is goodwill.<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** The heart knows its own bitterness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no stranger shares in its joy.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** The house of the wicked will be destroyed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the tent of the upright will flourish.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** There is a way that seems right to a man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but its end is the way of death.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** Even in laughter the heart may ache,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the end of joy may be sorrow.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** The backslider in heart will be filled with his own ways,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a good man will be satisfied from above.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** The simple believes every word,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the prudent gives thought to his steps.<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** A wise man fears and turns away from evil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the fool is arrogant and careless.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** A quick-tempered man acts foolishly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a man of evil devices is hated.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** The simple inherit folly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** The evil bow down before the good,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.<br/>
**<sup>20</sup>** The poor is hated even by his neighbor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the rich has many friends.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** He who despises his neighbor sins,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who shows kindness to the afflicted is blessed.<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** Do they not go astray who devise evil?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lovingkindness and truth belong to those who plan good.<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** In all labor there is profit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but mere talk leads only to poverty.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** The crown of the wise is their riches,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the folly of fools is only folly.<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** A truthful witness saves lives,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but one who breathes lies is deceitful.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** In the fear of the LORD there is strong confidence,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his children will have a refuge.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to turn away from the snares of death.<br/>
**<sup>28</sup>** In a multitude of people is the king's glory,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but in the lack of people is the downfall of a prince.<br/>
**<sup>29</sup>** He who is slow to anger has great understanding,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who is quick-tempered exalts folly.<br/>
**<sup>30</sup>** A tranquil heart is life to the body,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but envy is rottenness to the bones.<br/>
**<sup>31</sup>** He who oppresses the poor reproaches his Maker,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who honors Him shows kindness to the needy.<br/>
**<sup>32</sup>** The wicked is overthrown by his own wrongdoing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the righteous has a refuge in his death.<br/>
**<sup>33</sup>** Wisdom rests in the heart of him who has understanding,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what is in the inner parts of fools is made known.<br/>
**<sup>34</sup>** Righteousness exalts a nation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but sin is a reproach to any people.<br/>
**<sup>35</sup>** The king’s favor is toward a wise servant,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but his wrath is against him who causes shame.<br/>


## Chapter 15

**<sup>1</sup>** A soft answer turns away wrath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a harsh word stirs up anger.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** The tongue of the wise makes knowledge attractive,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the mouth of fools pours out folly.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** The eyes of the LORD are in every place,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;watching the evil and the good.

**<sup>4</sup>** A healing tongue is a tree of life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but perverseness in it breaks the spirit.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** A fool despises his father's discipline,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who heeds correction is prudent.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** In the house of the righteous there is much treasure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but in the income of the wicked is trouble.

**<sup>7</sup>** The lips of the wise spread knowledge,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the hearts of fools are not upright.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the prayer of the upright is his delight.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he loves one who pursues righteousness.

**<sup>10</sup>** Severe discipline is for him who forsakes the path,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who hates correction will die.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** The grave and destruction lie open before the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how much more the hearts of the sons of man!<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** A scoffer does not love one who corrects him;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will not go to the wise.

**<sup>13</sup>** A glad heart makes a cheerful face,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but by sorrow of heart the spirit is crushed.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** The heart of him who has understanding seeks knowledge,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the mouth of fools feeds on folly.

**<sup>15</sup>** All the days of the afflicted are evil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a cheerful heart has a continual feast.<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** Better is a little with the fear of the LORD<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than great treasure with turmoil.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** Better is a dish of vegetables where love is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than a fattened ox with hatred.

**<sup>18</sup>** A hot-tempered man stirs up strife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who is slow to anger quiets contention.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** The way of the sluggard is like a hedge of thorns,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the path of the upright is a highway.

**<sup>20</sup>** A wise son makes a glad father,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a foolish man despises his mother.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** Folly is a joy to one who lacks sense,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a man of understanding walks straight.

**<sup>22</sup>** Without counsel plans fail,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but with many advisers they succeed.<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** A man has joy in an apt answer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and how good is a word in its season!

**<sup>24</sup>** The path of life leads upward for the wise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he may turn away from the grave below.<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** The LORD will tear down the house of the proud,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he will establish the boundary of the widow.

**<sup>26</sup>** Evil plans are an abomination to the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but gracious words are pure.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who hates bribes will live.

**<sup>28</sup>** The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things.<br/>
**<sup>29</sup>** The LORD is far from the wicked,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he hears the prayer of the righteous.

**<sup>30</sup>** Bright eyes gladden the heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and good news strengthens the bones.<br/>
**<sup>31</sup>** The ear that listens to life-giving reproof<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will dwell among the wise.<br/>
**<sup>32</sup>** He who ignores discipline despises himself,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who listens to correction gains understanding.

**<sup>33</sup>** The fear of the LORD is instruction in wisdom,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and humility comes before honor.<br/>


## Chapter 16

**<sup>1</sup>** The plans of the heart belong to man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the answer of the tongue is from the LORD.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the LORD weighs the spirit.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** Commit your works to the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your plans will be established.

**<sup>4</sup>** The LORD has made everything for its purpose,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even the wicked for the day of trouble.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** Everyone who is arrogant in heart is an abomination to the LORD;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be assured, he will not go unpunished.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** By loyal love and truth is iniquity atoned for,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by the fear of the LORD one turns away from evil.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** When a man's ways please the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** Better is a little with righteousness<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than great revenues with injustice.

**<sup>9</sup>** The heart of man plans his way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the LORD establishes his steps.<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** A divine verdict is on the lips of a king;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his mouth must not be unfaithful in judgment.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** Honest scales and balances belong to the LORD;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the weights in the bag are his work.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** It is an abomination for kings to do evil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the throne is made secure by righteousness.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** Righteous lips are the delight of kings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who speaks uprightly is loved.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** The wrath of a king is a messenger of death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a wise man will appease it.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** In the light of the king’s face there is life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his favor is like a cloud of the spring rain.

**<sup>16</sup>** How much better to get wisdom than gold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to choose understanding rather than silver!<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** The highway of the upright turns aside from evil;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who guards his way preserves his soul.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** Pride goes before destruction,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a haughty spirit before a fall.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** Better to be of a humble spirit with the lowly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than to divide the spoil with the proud.

**<sup>20</sup>** He who gives attention to the word will find good,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and blessed is he who trusts in the LORD.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** The wise in heart will be called discerning,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sweetness of speech increases learning.<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the discipline of fools is folly.<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** The heart of the wise makes his mouth prudent,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and adds learning to his lips.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** Pleasant words are a honeycomb,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.

**<sup>25</sup>** There is a way that seems right to a man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but its end is the way of death.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** A worker’s appetite works for him,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for his hunger urges him on.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** A worthless man plots evil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his speech is like a scorching fire.<br/>
**<sup>28</sup>** A perverse man spreads strife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a whisperer separates close friends.

**<sup>29</sup>** A man of violence entices his neighbor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and leads him in a way that is not good.<br/>
**<sup>30</sup>** He who winks his eyes devises perverse things;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who purses his lips brings evil to pass.<br/>
**<sup>31</sup>** Gray hair is a crown of glory;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is gained in the way of righteousness.<br/>
**<sup>32</sup>** He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.<br/>
**<sup>33</sup>** The lot is cast into the lap,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but every decision is from the LORD.<br/>


## Chapter 17

**<sup>1</sup>** Better a dry morsel with quiet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than a house full of feasting with strife.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** A servant who acts wisely will rule over a disgraceful son,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will share in the inheritance among brothers.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** The crucible is for silver and the furnace for gold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the LORD tests hearts.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** An evildoer listens to wicked lips,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a liar pays attention to a destructive tongue.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** He who mocks the poor insults his Maker;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who rejoices at calamity will not go unpunished.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** Grandchildren are the crown of old men,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the glory of children is their fathers.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** Fine speech is not fitting for a fool—<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much less lying lips for a ruler.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** A bribe is like a charm in the eyes of its giver;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherever he turns, he succeeds.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** He who covers an offense promotes love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who repeats a matter separates close friends.<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** A rebuke sinks deeper into a discerning man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than a hundred blows into a fool.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** An evil man seeks only rebellion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a cruel messenger will be sent against him.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** Better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than a fool in his folly.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** He who returns evil for good—<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evil will not depart from his house.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** The beginning of strife is like letting out water,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so abandon the quarrel before it breaks out.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous—<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both are an abomination to the LORD.<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** Why should a fool have money in his hand to buy wisdom,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he has no heart for it?<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** A friend loves at all times,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a brother is born for adversity.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** A man lacking sense strikes hands in pledge<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and puts up security for his neighbor.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** He who loves transgression loves strife;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who builds a high gate seeks destruction.<br/>
**<sup>20</sup>** A crooked heart finds no good,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a perverse tongue falls into trouble.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** He who begets a fool does so to his sorrow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the father of a fool has no joy.<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** A joyful heart is good medicine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** A wicked man takes a bribe in secret<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to pervert the paths of justice.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** Wisdom is before the face of the discerning,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** A foolish son is grief to his father<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bitterness to her who bore him.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** It is not good to punish the righteous,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor to strike nobles for their integrity.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** He who restrains his words has knowledge,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding.<br/>
**<sup>28</sup>** Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is considered wise;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he shuts his lips, he is deemed intelligent.<br/>


## Chapter 18

**<sup>1</sup>** He who isolates himself seeks his own desire;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he breaks out against all sound judgment.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** A fool takes no pleasure in understanding,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but only in expressing his own opinion.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** When wickedness comes, contempt also comes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with dishonor comes disgrace.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** It is not good to be partial to the wicked<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or to deprive the righteous of justice.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** A fool’s lips bring strife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his mouth invites a beating.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** A fool’s mouth is his ruin,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his lips are a snare to his soul.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** The words of a whisperer are like tasty morsels;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they go down into the innermost parts of the body.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** Whoever is slack in his work<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a brother to him who destroys.<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** The name of the LORD is a strong tower;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the righteous man runs into it and is safe.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** A rich man’s wealth is his strong city,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and like a high wall in his own imagination.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** Before destruction a man’s heart is haughty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but humility comes before honor.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** If one gives an answer before he hears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is his folly and shame.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** A man’s spirit will endure sickness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a crushed spirit who can bear?<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** A man’s gift makes room for him<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and brings him before the great.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** The first to plead his case seems right,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until another comes and examines him.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** The lot puts an end to disputes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and decides between powerful contenders.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** A brother offended is more unyielding than a strong city,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and quarreling is like the bars of a fortress.<br/>
**<sup>20</sup>** From the fruit of a man’s mouth his stomach is satisfied;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is satisfied by the yield of his lips.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** Death and life are in the power of the tongue,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who love it will eat its fruit.<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** He who finds a wife finds a good thing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and obtains favor from the LORD.<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** The poor man speaks with entreaties,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the rich man answers roughly.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** A man of many companions may come to ruin,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.<br/>


## Chapter 19

**<sup>1</sup>** Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than one who is perverse in his lips and is a fool.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** Also, it is not good for a soul to be without knowledge,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who hurries with his feet misses the way.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** A man’s own folly subverts his way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet his heart rages against the LORD.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** Wealth adds many friends,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the poor man is separated from his friend.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** A false witness will not go unpunished,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who breathes lies will not escape.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** Many seek the favor of a nobleman,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and every man is a friend to him who gives gifts.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** All the brothers of a poor man hate him;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how much more do his friends keep far from him!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pursues them with words, but they are gone.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** He who gets wisdom loves his own soul;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who keeps understanding will find good.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** A false witness will not go unpunished,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who breathes lies will perish.<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** Luxury is not fitting for a fool,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much less for a slave to rule over princes.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** A man’s discretion makes him slow to anger,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it is his glory to overlook an offense.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** The king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but his favor is like dew upon the grass.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** A foolish son is the calamity of his father,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a contentious wife is like a constant dripping.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** House and wealth are an inheritance from fathers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a prudent wife is from the LORD.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** Laziness casts into a deep sleep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the idle soul will suffer hunger.<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who despises his ways will die.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** He who shows kindness to the poor lends to the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and He will repay him for his deed.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** Discipline your son while there is hope,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but do not set your heart on causing his death.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** A man of great wrath will bear the penalty;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for if you rescue him, you will have to do it again.<br/>
**<sup>20</sup>** Listen to counsel and receive instruction,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you may be wise in your latter days.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** Many are the plans in a man’s heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the counsel of the LORD will stand.<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** The charm of a man is his kindness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it is better to be poor than a liar.<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** The fear of the LORD leads to life;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then one rests satisfied, untouched by evil.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** The sluggard buries his hand in the dish,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will not even bring it back to his mouth.<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** Strike a scoffer, and the simple will become prudent;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reprove one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** He who plunders his father and drives away his mother<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** Cease, my son, to hear instruction<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that causes you to stray from the words of knowledge.<br/>
**<sup>28</sup>** A worthless witness mocks at justice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the mouth of the wicked swallows iniquity.<br/>
**<sup>29</sup>** Judgments are prepared for scoffers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and blows for the backs of fools.<br/>


## Chapter 20

**<sup>1</sup>** Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whoever is led astray by it is not wise.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** The terror of a king is like the growl of a lion;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whoever provokes him to anger sins against his own life.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** It is an honor for a man to avoid strife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but every fool is quick to quarrel.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** The sluggard does not plow in autumn;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will seek at harvest and have nothing.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** The purpose in a man’s heart is like deep water,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a man of understanding will draw it out.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** Many a man proclaims his own steadfast love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a faithful man who can find?<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** The righteous man walks in his integrity;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blessed are his children after him.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** A king who sits on the throne of judgment<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;winnows all evil with his eyes.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** Who can say, “I have made my heart pure;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am clean from my sin”?<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** Unequal weights and unequal measures<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are both alike an abomination to the LORD.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** Even a child makes himself known by his deeds,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether his conduct is pure and right.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** The hearing ear and the seeing eye,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD has made them both.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** Do not love sleep, lest you come to poverty;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open your eyes, and you will have plenty of bread.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** “Bad, bad,” says the buyer;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but when he goes his way, then he boasts.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** There is gold, and an abundance of jewels,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the lips of knowledge are a precious vessel.<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** Take a man’s garment when he has put up security for a stranger,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hold it in pledge when it is for foreigners.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** Bread gained by deceit is sweet to a man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but afterward his mouth will be full of gravel.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** Plans are established by counsel;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by wise guidance wage war.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** He who goes about as a slanderer reveals secrets;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore do not associate with one who opens his lips.<br/>
**<sup>20</sup>** Whoever curses his father or his mother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his lamp will be put out in utter darkness.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** An inheritance gained hastily in the beginning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will not be blessed in the end.<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** Do not say, “I will repay evil”;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wait for the LORD, and He will save you.<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** Unequal weights are an abomination to the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and false scales are not good.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** A man’s steps are from the LORD;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how then can man understand his way?<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** It is a snare to say rashly, “It is holy,”<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to reflect only after making vows.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** A wise king winnows the wicked<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and drives the wheel over them.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;searching all the innermost parts.<br/>
**<sup>28</sup>** Steadfast love and faithfulness preserve the king,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by steadfast love his throne is upheld.<br/>
**<sup>29</sup>** The glory of young men is their strength,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the splendor of old men is their gray hair.<br/>
**<sup>30</sup>** Blows that wound cleanse away evil;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strokes make clean the innermost parts.<br/>


## Chapter 21

**<sup>1</sup>** The king’s heart is a stream of water in the hand of the LORD;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turns it wherever He will.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the LORD weighs the hearts.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** To do righteousness and justice<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** Haughty eyes and a proud heart—<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lamp of the wicked—is sin.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** The plans of the diligent surely lead to abundance,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** The getting of treasures by a lying tongue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a fleeting vapor, a snare of death.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** The violence of the wicked will sweep them away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they refuse to do what is just.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** The way of a guilty man is crooked,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the conduct of the pure is upright.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife.<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** The soul of the wicked desires evil;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** When a scoffer is punished, the simple become wise;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the wise is instructed, he gains knowledge.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** The Righteous One observes the house of the wicked;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brings the wicked to ruin.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** Whoever shuts his ear to the cry of the poor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will himself call and not be answered.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** A gift in secret averts anger,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a bribe in the bosom, strong wrath.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** It is a joy to the righteous to do justice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but terror to evildoers.<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** The man who wanders from the way of understanding<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will rest in the assembly of the dead.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** He who loves pleasure will be a poor man;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he who loves wine and oil will not be rich.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** The wicked is a ransom for the righteous,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the treacherous for the upright.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** It is better to dwell in a desert land<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than with a quarrelsome and fretful woman.<br/>
**<sup>20</sup>** Precious treasure and oil are in the dwelling of the wise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a foolish man devours it.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** He who pursues righteousness and steadfast love<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will find life, righteousness, and honor.<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** A wise man scales the city of the mighty<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and brings down the stronghold in which they trust.<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keeps himself out of trouble.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** “Scoffer” is the name of the arrogant, haughty man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who acts with arrogant pride.<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** The desire of the sluggard kills him,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for his hands refuse to labor.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** All day long he craves and craves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the righteous gives and does not hold back.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination—<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how much more when he brings it with evil intent.<br/>
**<sup>28</sup>** A false witness will perish,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the man who listens will speak with knowledge.<br/>
**<sup>29</sup>** A wicked man puts on a bold face,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the upright gives thought to his ways.<br/>
**<sup>30</sup>** No wisdom, no understanding, no counsel<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can avail against the LORD.<br/>
**<sup>31</sup>** The horse is made ready for the day of battle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the victory belongs to the LORD.<br/>


## Chapter 22

**<sup>1</sup>** A good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and favor is better than silver and gold.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** The rich and the poor meet together;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD is the Maker of them all.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** The prudent sees danger and hides himself,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the simple go on and suffer for it.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** The reward for humility and the fear of the LORD<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is riches and honor and life.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** Thorns and snares are in the path of the crooked;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whoever guards his soul will keep far from them.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** Train up a child in the way he should go;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even when he is old he will not turn from it.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** The rich rules over the poor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the borrower is servant to the lender.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** Whoever sows injustice will reap trouble,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rod of his fury will fail.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** He who has a generous eye will be blessed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he shares his bread with the poor.<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** Drive out the scoffer, and strife will go out;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quarreling and abuse will cease.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** He who loves purity of heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whose speech is gracious, will have the king as his friend.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** The eyes of the LORD keep watch over knowledge,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but He overthrows the words of the treacherous.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be killed in the streets!”<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** The mouth of forbidden women is a deep pit;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he with whom the LORD is angry will fall into it.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the rod of discipline drives it far from him.<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and apply your heart to my knowledge.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** For it will be pleasant if you keep them within you,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if all of them are ready on your lips.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** That your trust may be in the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make them known to you today, even to you.<br/>
**<sup>20</sup>** Have I not written for you thirty sayings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of counsel and knowledge,<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** to make you know what is right and true,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you may give a true answer to those who send you?<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** Do not rob the poor, because he is poor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or crush the afflicted at the gate;<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** for the LORD will plead their cause<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rob of life those who rob them.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** Make no friendship with a man given to anger,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor go with a wrathful man,<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** lest you learn his ways<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and entangle yourself in a snare.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** Be not one of those who give pledges,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who put up security for debts.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** If you have nothing with which to pay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why should your bed be taken from under you?<br/>
**<sup>28</sup>** Do not move the ancient landmark<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that your fathers have set.<br/>
**<sup>29</sup>** Do you see a man skillful in his work?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will stand before kings;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will not stand before obscure men.<br/>


## Chapter 23

**<sup>1</sup>** When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider carefully what is before you, **<sup>2</sup>** and put a knife to your throat if you are a man given to appetite. **<sup>3</sup>** Do not crave his delicacies, for they are deceptive food.

**<sup>4</sup>** Do not toil to become rich; cease from your own understanding. **<sup>5</sup>** When your eyes look on it, it is gone, for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away like an eagle toward heaven.

**<sup>6</sup>** Do not eat the bread of a stingy man, nor desire his delicacies, **<sup>7</sup>** for as he calculates within himself, so he is. “Eat and drink,” he says to you, but his heart is not with you. **<sup>8</sup>** You will vomit the morsel you have eaten and waste your pleasant words.

**<sup>9</sup>** Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words.

**<sup>10</sup>** Do not move the ancient boundary, and do not enter the fields of the fatherless, **<sup>11</sup>** for their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their cause against you.

**<sup>12</sup>** Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge.

**<sup>13</sup>** Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you strike him with the rod, he will not die. **<sup>14</sup>** You shall strike him with the rod and deliver his life from the grave.

**<sup>15</sup>** My son, if your heart is wise, my heart too will rejoice; **<sup>16</sup>** my inmost being will exult when your lips speak what is right.

**<sup>17</sup>** Do not let your heart envy sinners, but live in the fear of the LORD all day long. **<sup>18</sup>** For surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.

**<sup>19</sup>** Hear, my son, and be wise, and direct your heart in the way. **<sup>20</sup>** Do not be among heavy drinkers of wine or among gluttonous eaters of meat, **<sup>21</sup>** for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe one with rags.

**<sup>22</sup>** Listen to your father who begot you, and do not despise your mother when she is old. **<sup>23</sup>** Buy truth and do not sell it—wisdom and instruction and understanding.

**<sup>24</sup>** The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; he who fathers a wise son will delight in him. **<sup>25</sup>** Let your father and your mother be glad; let her who bore you rejoice.

**<sup>26</sup>** My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes delight in my ways. **<sup>27</sup>** For a prostitute is a deep pit, and a wayward woman is a narrow well. **<sup>28</sup>** She lies in wait like a robber and increases the faithless among men.

**<sup>29</sup>** Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes? **<sup>30</sup>** Those who linger long over wine, those who go to seek mixed wine. **<sup>31</sup>** Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly. **<sup>32</sup>** In the end it bites like a serpent and stings like a viper. **<sup>33</sup>** Your eyes will see strange things, and your heart will utter perverse things. **<sup>34</sup>** You will be like one lying down in the midst of the sea, or like one lying on the top of a mast. **<sup>35</sup>** “They struck me,” you will say, “but I was not hurt; they beat me, but I did not feel it. When shall I awake? I will seek it again.” 

## Chapter 24

**<sup>1</sup>** Do not envy men of evil, nor desire to be with them; **<sup>2</sup>** for violence is in their heart, and their lips speak of trouble. **<sup>3</sup>** By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established; **<sup>4</sup>** and by knowledge its rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant wealth. **<sup>5</sup>** A wise man is strong; and a man of knowledge increases power. **<sup>6</sup>** For by wise counsel you wage your war, and in the multitude of advisers there is safety. **<sup>7</sup>** Wisdom is as precious stones to a fool; in the gate he will not open his mouth. **<sup>8</sup>** He who devises evil is called a man of schemes. **<sup>9</sup>** The devising of foolishness is sin, and the scorner is an abomination to man. **<sup>10</sup>** If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small indeed. **<sup>11</sup>** Rescue those being led away to death; and those staggering to be slain, hold back. **<sup>12</sup>** For if you say, “We did not know this,” does He not weigh the hearts? And He who guards your soul knows; and He will repay man according to his work. **<sup>13</sup>** Eat honey, my son, for it is good; and the honeycomb is sweet to your taste. **<sup>14</sup>** So know wisdom for your soul; if you have found it, then there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.

**<sup>15</sup>** Do not lurk, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; do not plunder his resting-place. **<sup>16</sup>** For a righteous man may fall seven times, and rise again; but the wicked stumble in calamity. **<sup>17</sup>** Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles, **<sup>18</sup>** lest the LORD see, and it displease Him, and He turn His wrath away from him.

**<sup>19</sup>** Do not fret because of evildoers, and do not envy the wicked; **<sup>20</sup>** for there will be no future for evil men; the lamp of the wicked will be put out. **<sup>21</sup>** My son, fear the LORD and the king; do not mingle with those given to change. **<sup>22</sup>** For their calamity will rise suddenly, and who knows the disaster of both of them?

**<sup>23</sup>** These also are sayings of the wise: to show partiality in judgment is not good. **<sup>24</sup>** He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous”—peoples will curse him, nations will be angry with him. **<sup>25</sup>** But to those who correct him there will be delight; and a good blessing will come upon them. **<sup>26</sup>** Let lips kiss him who gives a right answer.

**<sup>27</sup>** Prepare your work outside, and make it ready in the field for yourself; then afterwards build your house. **<sup>28</sup>** Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause; and do not deceive with your lips. **<sup>29</sup>** Do not say, “As he did to me, so will I do to him; I will repay the man according to his work.”

**<sup>30</sup>** I passed by the field of a lazy man, and by the vineyard of a man without sense; **<sup>31</sup>** and lo, it was all overgrown with thorns; its surface was covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down. **<sup>32</sup>** Then I looked, and considered; I saw, and received instruction. **<sup>33</sup>** A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest; **<sup>34</sup>** and poverty will come on you like a robber, and want like an armed man. 

## Chapter 25

**<sup>1</sup>** These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied.

**<sup>2</sup>** It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the glory of kings to search a matter out.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** The heavens for height, and the earth for depth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the heart of kings is unsearchable.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** Remove dross from silver,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a vessel comes forth for the smith.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** Remove the wicked from before the king,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his throne will be established in righteousness.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do not stand in the place of great men;<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** for it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,”<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than that you be brought low before a noble.

**<sup>8</sup>** Do not go out hastily to contend,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lest you do not know what to do in the end<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when your neighbor humiliates you.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** Argue your case with your neighbor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but do not reveal another man’s secret,<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** lest he who hears shame you,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your bad report never turn away.

**<sup>11</sup>** A word fitly spoken<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is like apples of gold in settings of silver.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** Like a ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a wise reprover to an obedient ear.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** Like the cold of snow in harvest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a faithful messenger to those who send him,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he restores the life of his masters.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** A man who boasts of a gift he does not give<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is like clouds and wind without rain.

**<sup>15</sup>** By patience a ruler may be persuaded,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a soft tongue breaks a bone.<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** If you find honey, eat only what is enough for you,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lest you be filled with it and vomit it.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lest he be weary of you and hate you.

**<sup>18</sup>** A man who bears false witness against his neighbor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a club, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** Trust in an unfaithful man in time of trouble<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a broken tooth and a slipping foot.<br/>
**<sup>20</sup>** One who removes a garment in cold weather,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and vinegar on soda,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is he who sings songs to a heavy heart.

**<sup>21</sup>** If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink;<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** for you will heap coals on his head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the LORD will reward you.

**<sup>23</sup>** The north wind brings forth rain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a backbiting tongue an angry face.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** It is better to live on the corner of a roof<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than with a quarrelsome woman in a house together.

**<sup>25</sup>** Like cold water to a weary soul<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is good news from a distant land.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** A righteous man who gives way before the wicked<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a muddied spring and a polluted fountain.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** It is not good to eat much honey,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor to seek out one’s own glory.<br/>
**<sup>28</sup>** A man without self-control<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a city broken down, without walls.<br/>


## Chapter 26

**<sup>1</sup>** Like snow in summer and rain in harvest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so honor is not fitting for a fool.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** Like a fluttering sparrow, like a flying swallow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so a curse without cause does not come.

**<sup>3</sup>** A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a rod for the back of fools.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** Do not answer a fool according to his folly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lest you also become like him.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** Answer a fool according to his folly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lest he be wise in his own eyes.

**<sup>6</sup>** He who sends a message by the hand of a fool<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cuts off his own feet and drinks violence.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** The legs of the lame hang useless;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so is a proverb in the mouth of fools.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** Like one who binds a stone in a sling<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is he who gives honor to a fool.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a proverb in the mouth of fools.<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** A master may form all things,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who hires a fool hires passers-by.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** As a dog returns to its vomit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so a fool repeats his folly.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more hope for a fool than for him.

**<sup>13</sup>** The sluggard says, “A lion is in the road;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a lion is in the streets.”<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** A door turns on its hinges,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a sluggard on his bed.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is weary of bringing it back to his mouth.<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** A sluggard is wiser in his own eyes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than seven men who answer sensibly.

**<sup>17</sup>** He who seizes a dog by the ears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a man passing by who gets involved in another’s quarrel.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** Like a madman who throws firebrands,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arrows, and death,<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** is the man who deceives his neighbor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and says, “I was only joking.”

**<sup>20</sup>** Where there is no wood, the fire goes out;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and where there is no whisperer, contention quiets.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** As charcoal to embers and wood to fire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so is a contentious man to kindle strife.<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** The words of a whisperer are like tasty morsels;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they go down into the innermost parts.

**<sup>23</sup>** Like silver glaze on earthenware<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are fervent lips with an evil heart.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** He who hates disguises himself with his lips,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but stores up deceit within him.<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** When he makes his voice gracious, do not trust him,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for seven abominations are in his heart.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** Though his hatred is covered by deceit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his wickedness will be revealed in the assembly.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** He who digs a pit will fall into it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who rolls a stone, it will return upon him.<br/>
**<sup>28</sup>** A lying tongue hates its crushed victims,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a flattering mouth brings ruin.<br/>


## Chapter 27

**<sup>1</sup>** Do not boast about tomorrow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you do not know what a day will bring.

**<sup>2</sup>** Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a stranger, and not your own lips.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** A stone is heavy, and sand is weighty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but who can stand before jealousy?

**<sup>5</sup>** Better is open rebuke<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than hidden love.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** Faithful are the wounds of a friend,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but profuse are the kisses of an enemy.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** A full soul tramples honeycomb,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but to a hungry soul everything bitter is sweet.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** Like a bird wandering from its nest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a man wandering from his place.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** Oil and perfume gladden the heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the sweetness of a friend comes from earnest counsel.<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** Do not forsake your friend or your father’s friend,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do not go to your brother’s house in the day of your calamity;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better is a neighbor who is near<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than a brother who is far away.

**<sup>11</sup>** Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that I may answer him who taunts me.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** A prudent man sees danger and hides himself,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the simple pass on and suffer for it.

**<sup>13</sup>** Take his garment who is surety for a stranger,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and take a pledge from him for a foreign woman.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** He who blesses his friend with a loud voice early in the morning—<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will be counted as a curse to him.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** A continual dripping on a rainy day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a quarrelsome woman are alike;<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** he who restrains her restrains the wind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and grasps oil with his right hand.

**<sup>17</sup>** Iron sharpens iron,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a man sharpens the face of his friend.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** He who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who guards his master will be honored.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** As water reflects a face,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so a man’s heart reflects the man.<br/>
**<sup>20</sup>** The grave and destruction are never satisfied,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a man’s eyes are never satisfied.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** The crucible is for silver, and the furnace for gold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a man is tested by the praise he receives.<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** Though you crush a fool in a mortar<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a pestle along with grain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his folly will not depart from him.

**<sup>23</sup>** Know well the condition of your flock;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set your heart to your herds,<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** for wealth is not forever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor does a crown endure to all generations.<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** When the grass disappears and new growth is seen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the herbs of the mountains are gathered,<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** lambs will provide your clothing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and goats the price of a field;<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** and there will be goats’ milk enough for your food,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the food of your household,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sustenance for your maidens.<br/>


## Chapter 28

**<sup>1</sup>** The wicked flee when no man pursues,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the righteous are as bold as a lion.

**<sup>2</sup>** Because of the transgression of a land its princes are many,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but by a man of understanding and knowledge it endures.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** A poor man who oppresses the lowly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a sweeping rain that leaves no food.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but those who keep the law contend with them.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** Evil men do not understand justice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but those who seek the LORD understand everything.

**<sup>6</sup>** Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than a perverse man who is rich.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** He who keeps the law is a wise son,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who keeps company with gluttons disgraces his father.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** He who increases his wealth by interest and profit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gathers it for him who shows grace to the poor.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** He who turns his ear away from hearing the law—<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even his prayer is an abomination.

**<sup>10</sup>** He who misleads the upright into an evil path<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will fall into his own pit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the blameless will inherit good.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** A rich man is wise in his own eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a discerning poor man searches him out.

**<sup>12</sup>** When the righteous triumph, there is great glory,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** Happy is the man who is always cautious,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who hardens his heart will fall into trouble.

**<sup>15</sup>** A roaring lion and a charging bear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a wicked ruler over a poor people.<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** A prince lacking understanding is a great oppressor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who hates unjust gain will prolong his days.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** A man burdened with the blood of another<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will flee to the pit; let no man support him.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** He who walks blamelessly will be delivered,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who is crooked in his ways will fall at once.

**<sup>19</sup>** He who works his land will have plenty of bread,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who pursues worthless things will have plenty of poverty.<br/>
**<sup>20</sup>** A faithful man will abound with blessings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who hastens to be rich will not go unpunished.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** To show partiality is not good,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet for a piece of bread a man will do wrong.<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** A man with an evil eye hastens after wealth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and does not know that want will come upon him.<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** He who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than he who flatters with the tongue.

**<sup>24</sup>** He who robs his father or his mother and says, “It is no transgression,”<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a companion to a destroyer.<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** A greedy man stirs up strife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who trusts in the LORD will prosper.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** He who trusts in his own heart is a fool,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who walks in wisdom will escape.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** He who gives to the poor will lack nothing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who hides his eyes will receive many curses.

**<sup>28</sup>** When the wicked rise, men hide themselves;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but when they perish, the righteous increase.<br/>


## Chapter 29

**<sup>1</sup>** A man who stiffens his neck after many rebukes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will suddenly be broken without remedy.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** When the righteous increase, a nation rejoices,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but when a wicked man rules, a nation groans.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** A man who loves wisdom gladdens his father,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but one who keeps company with prostitutes wastes wealth.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** By justice a king establishes a land,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a man who takes bribes tears it down.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** A man who flatters his neighbor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spreads a net for his feet.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** In the transgression of a wicked man there is a snare,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a righteous man sings and rejoices.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** A righteous man cares for the cause of the poor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a wicked man understands nothing.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** Scoffers set a city on fire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the wise turn away wrath.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** When a wise man disputes with a fool,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fool rages or laughs, and there is no rest.<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** Men of blood hate one who is blameless,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the upright seek his life to protect it.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** A fool gives full vent to his spirit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a wise man quietly holds it back.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** If a ruler listens to lies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all his servants become wicked.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** The poor man and the oppressor meet together;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD gives light to the eyes of both.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** If a king judges the poor with truth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his throne will be established forever.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** A rod and reproof give wisdom,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother.<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** When the wicked increase, transgression increases,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the righteous will look on their downfall.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** Discipline your son, and he will give you rest;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will give delight to your soul.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** Where there is no vision, a man casts off restraint,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who keeps the law is blessed.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** A servant will not be corrected by words,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he understands, yet he will not respond.<br/>
**<sup>20</sup>** Do you see a man hasty in his words?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more hope for a fool than for him.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** If a man pampers his servant from youth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the end that servant will act as a son.<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** A man of anger stirs up strife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a hot-tempered man commits many transgressions.<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** A man’s pride brings him low,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a man of lowly spirit will obtain honor.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** Whoever shares with a thief hates his own life;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he hears the oath to testify but says nothing.<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** The fear of man lays a snare,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but whoever trusts in the LORD is set secure.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** Many seek the face of a ruler,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a man’s justice comes from the LORD.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** A wicked man is an abomination to the righteous,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.<br/>


## Chapter 30

**<sup>1</sup>** The words of Agur son of Jakeh—the utterance:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man declares to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:

**<sup>2</sup>** Surely I am more brutish than any man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I do not have a man’s understanding.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** I have not learned wisdom,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor do I know the knowledge of the Holy One.

**<sup>4</sup>** Who has gone up to heaven and come down?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has gathered the wind in his fists?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has wrapped the waters in a garment?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has established all the ends of the earth?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is his name, and what is his son’s name? You know.

**<sup>5</sup>** Every word of God is refined;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** Do not add to his words<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lest he reprove you and you be found a liar.

**<sup>7</sup>** Two things I ask of you;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not withhold them from me before I die:<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** Remove falsehood and lying far from me;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give me neither poverty nor riches—<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feed me with the food allotted to me,<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** lest I become full and deny you and say, “Who is the LORD?”<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or lest I become poor and steal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and profane the name of my God.

**<sup>10</sup>** Do not slander a servant to his master,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lest he curse you and you be found guilty.

**<sup>11</sup>** There is a generation that curses its father<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and does not bless its mother.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet is not washed from its filth.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** There is a generation—how lofty are their eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their eyelids are lifted high.

**<sup>14</sup>** There is a generation whose teeth are swords<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whose jaw teeth are knives,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to devour the afflicted from the earth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the needy from among men.

**<sup>15</sup>** The leech has two daughters: “Give” and “Give.”<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three things are never satisfied;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;four never say, “Enough”:<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** the grave, and the barren womb,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth that is never filled with water,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fire that never says, “Enough.”

**<sup>17</sup>** The eye that mocks a father<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and scorns obedience to a mother—<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ravens of the valley will pluck it out,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the young eagles will eat it.

**<sup>18</sup>** Three things are too wondrous for me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and four I do not understand:<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** the way of an eagle in the sky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way of a serpent on a rock,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way of a ship in the heart of the sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the way of a man with a young woman.

**<sup>20</sup>** This is the way of an adulterous woman:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she eats and wipes her mouth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and says, “I have done no wrong.”

**<sup>21</sup>** Under three things the earth trembles,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and under four it cannot bear up:<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** under a servant when he becomes king,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a fool when he is satisfied with food,<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** under a hated woman when she is married,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a maidservant when she displaces her mistress.

**<sup>24</sup>** Four things on the earth are small,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are exceedingly wise:<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** the ants are a people not strong,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet they prepare their food in the summer;<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** the rock badgers are not a mighty people,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet they make their house in the cliffs;<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** the locusts have no king,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet they all march in ranks;<br/>
**<sup>28</sup>** the lizard you can grasp with your hands,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet it is in kings’ palaces.

**<sup>29</sup>** Three things have a stately stride,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and four are stately in their walk:<br/>
**<sup>30</sup>** the lion, mighty among beasts,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who does not turn back from anything;

**<sup>31</sup>** the strutting rooster, or the he-goat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a king when his army is with him.

**<sup>32</sup>** If you have been foolish in exalting yourself,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or if you have devised evil, put your hand to your mouth.<br/>
**<sup>33</sup>** For pressing milk produces curds,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pressing the nose produces blood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pressing anger produces strife.<br/>


## Chapter 31

**<sup>1</sup>** The words of Lemuel, king—the utterance<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that his mother taught him:

**<sup>2</sup>** What, my son?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what, son of my womb?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what, son of my vows?<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** Do not give your strength to women,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor your ways to those who destroy kings.

**<sup>4</sup>** It is not for kings, O Lemuel,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is not for kings to drink wine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor for rulers to crave strong drink,<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** lest he drink and forget what is decreed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pervert the justice of any of the afflicted.

**<sup>6</sup>** Give strong drink to the one who is perishing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wine to those bitter of soul;<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** let him drink and forget his poverty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let him remember his misery no more.

**<sup>8</sup>** Open your mouth for the mute,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the rights of all who are passing away.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** Open your mouth, judge righteously,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and defend the poor and needy.

**<sup>10</sup>** A woman of valor, who can find her?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her worth is far beyond rubies.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** The heart of her husband trusts in her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will have no lack of gain.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** She does him good and not harm<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the days of her life.

**<sup>13</sup>** She seeks wool and flax<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and works with willing hands.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** She is like the merchant ships;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she brings her food from afar.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** She rises while it is still night<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gives food to her household<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a portion to her maidservants.

**<sup>16</sup>** She considers a field and buys it;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** She girds her waist with strength<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and makes her arms strong.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** She perceives that her merchandise is good;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her lamp does not go out at night.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** She stretches out her hands to the distaff,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her palms grasp the spindle.

**<sup>20</sup>** She opens her hand to the poor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and reaches out her hands to the needy.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** She is not afraid for her household because of snow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all her household are clothed in scarlet.<br/>
**<sup>22</sup>** She makes coverings for herself;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her clothing is fine linen and purple.

**<sup>23</sup>** Her husband is known in the gates,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he sits among the elders of the land.<br/>
**<sup>24</sup>** She makes linen garments and sells them<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and supplies sashes to the merchant.

**<sup>25</sup>** Strength and splendor are her clothing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and she laughs at the days to come.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** She opens her mouth with wisdom,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and faithful instruction is on her tongue.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** She watches over the ways of her household<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and does not eat the bread of idleness.

**<sup>28</sup>** Her children rise up and call her blessed;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her husband also, and he praises her:<br/>
**<sup>29</sup>** “Many daughters have done valorously,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you surpass them all.”

**<sup>30</sup>** Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.<br/>
**<sup>31</sup>** Give her the fruit of her hands,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let her works praise her in the gates.<br/>
