# The Epistle of Paul to the Philippians

## Chapter 1

**<sup>1</sup>** Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, along with the elders and deacons:

**<sup>2</sup>** Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

**<sup>3</sup>** I thank my God every time I remember you, **<sup>4</sup>** always in every prayer of mine for all of you, praying with joy, **<sup>5</sup>** because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. **<sup>6</sup>** And I am confident of this: that he who began a good work in you will complete it by the day of Christ Jesus.

**<sup>7</sup>** It is right for me to think this way about all of you, because I have you in my heart—both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you are all sharers with me in grace. **<sup>8</sup>** For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.

**<sup>9</sup>** And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and all discernment, **<sup>10</sup>** so that you may approve what is excellent, and be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, **<sup>11</sup>** filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

**<sup>12</sup>** Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has actually advanced the gospel. **<sup>13</sup>** As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that my imprisonment is for Christ. **<sup>14</sup>** And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.

**<sup>15</sup>** Some, to be sure, preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. **<sup>16</sup>** The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel; **<sup>17</sup>** the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, thinking they will stir up trouble for me while I am in chains. **<sup>18</sup>** What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed—and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, **<sup>19</sup>** for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.

**<sup>20</sup>** It is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be ashamed in anything, but that with full courage, now as always, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death. **<sup>21</sup>** For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain. **<sup>22</sup>** But if I live in the flesh, this means fruitful labor for me—yet I do not know which I prefer. **<sup>23</sup>** I am torn between the two: I have the desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. **<sup>24</sup>** But to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake. **<sup>25</sup>** Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you, for your progress and joy in the faith, **<sup>26</sup>** so that your pride in Christ Jesus may overflow on account of me through my coming to you again.

**<sup>27</sup>** Only live in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you—that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel, **<sup>28</sup>** and not frightened of anything by your opponents. This is a sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation—and this is from God. **<sup>29</sup>** For it has been granted to you for the sake of Christ not only to believe in him but also to suffer for his sake, **<sup>30</sup>** since you are experiencing the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have. 

## Chapter 2

**<sup>1</sup>** So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any fellowship in the Spirit, any affection and compassion, **<sup>2</sup>** then make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same love, being united in spirit and intent on one purpose. **<sup>3</sup>** Do nothing from selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility regard one another as more important than yourselves. **<sup>4</sup>** Let each of you look, not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.

**<sup>5</sup>** Let this mindset be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, **<sup>6</sup>** who, though He existed in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be exploited, **<sup>7</sup>** but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. **<sup>8</sup>** And being found in human form, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death—even death on a cross. **<sup>9</sup>** Therefore God highly exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name, **<sup>10</sup>** so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow—in heaven and on earth and under the earth— **<sup>11</sup>** and that every tongue would confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

**<sup>12</sup>** So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence but now much more in my absence—work out your salvation with fear and trembling. **<sup>13</sup>** For it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure.

**<sup>14</sup>** Do all things without grumbling or arguing, **<sup>15</sup>** so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, **<sup>16</sup>** holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may have reason to boast that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. **<sup>17</sup>** But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with all of you. **<sup>18</sup>** Likewise, you also should rejoice and share your joy with me.

**<sup>19</sup>** I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be encouraged when I learn of your condition. **<sup>20</sup>** For I have no one else like him, who will genuinely care about your welfare. **<sup>21</sup>** For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. **<sup>22</sup>** But you know his proven character, that as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel. **<sup>23</sup>** Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with me. **<sup>24</sup>** And I trust in the Lord that I myself will come soon also.

**<sup>25</sup>** But I thought it necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus—my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my needs. **<sup>26</sup>** For he has been longing for all of you and was distressed because you heard that he was sick. **<sup>27</sup>** Indeed he was sick, nearly to the point of death. But God had mercy on him—and not only on him but also on me, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. **<sup>28</sup>** Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again, you may rejoice and I may be less anxious. **<sup>29</sup>** So welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor such men, **<sup>30</sup>** because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for what was lacking in your service to me. 

## Chapter 3

**<sup>1</sup>** Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you again is not burdensome for me, and it is a safeguard for you.

**<sup>2</sup>** Watch out for the dogs, watch out for the evil workers, watch out for those who mutilate the flesh. **<sup>3</sup>** For we are the true circumcision—those who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh— **<sup>4</sup>** although I myself have grounds for confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he has reason to be confident in the flesh, I have more: **<sup>5</sup>** circumcised on the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; **<sup>6</sup>** as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, faultless.

**<sup>7</sup>** But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. **<sup>8</sup>** More than that, I consider all things loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus as my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and consider them garbage, in order that I may gain Christ **<sup>9</sup>** and be found in him—not having a righteousness of my own from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith. **<sup>10</sup>** I want to know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death, **<sup>11</sup>** so that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.

**<sup>12</sup>** Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfected, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus also took hold of me. **<sup>13</sup>** Brothers, I do not consider myself to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: forgetting what is behind and reaching forward to what is ahead, **<sup>14</sup>** I press on toward the goal, to win the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

**<sup>15</sup>** Let all of us who are mature think this way. And if in anything you think differently, God will reveal that to you as well. **<sup>16</sup>** Only let us hold fast to what we have already attained.

**<sup>17</sup>** Join in imitating me, brothers, and keep your eyes on those who live according to the example you have in us. **<sup>18</sup>** For many—whom I have often told you about and now tell you even with tears—live as enemies of the cross of Christ. **<sup>19</sup>** Their end is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their minds are set on earthly things. **<sup>20</sup>** But our citizenship is in heaven, and from there we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, **<sup>21</sup>** who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him to subject all things to himself. 

## Chapter 4

**<sup>1</sup>** So then, my beloved and longed-for brothers, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends.

**<sup>2</sup>** I urge Euodia and Syntyche to agree in the Lord. **<sup>3</sup>** Yes, I also ask you, true companion, help these women who contended alongside me in the gospel, together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.

**<sup>4</sup>** Rejoice in the Lord always; I will say it again: rejoice! **<sup>5</sup>** Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is near. **<sup>6</sup>** Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. **<sup>7</sup>** And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

**<sup>8</sup>** Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable—if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—think about these things. **<sup>9</sup>** What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.

**<sup>10</sup>** I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that now at last your concern for me has revived. Indeed, you were concerned, but you lacked the opportunity to show it. **<sup>11</sup>** I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content in whatever situation I am in. **<sup>12</sup>** I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In every circumstance and in all things, I have learned the secret of being well-fed and going hungry, of having abundance and suffering need. **<sup>13</sup>** I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.

**<sup>14</sup>** Still, you did well to share in my affliction. **<sup>15</sup>** You yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church partnered with me in giving and receiving except you alone. **<sup>16</sup>** Even in Thessalonica you sent gifts more than once for my needs. **<sup>17</sup>** Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the profit that increases to your account. **<sup>18</sup>** I have received everything in full, and more. I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you sent—a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. **<sup>19</sup>** And my God will supply all your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. **<sup>20</sup>** To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.

**<sup>21</sup>** Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you. **<sup>22</sup>** All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar’s household. **<sup>23</sup>** The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
