# The Second General Epistle of Peter

## Chapter 1

**<sup>1</sup>** Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received a faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ: **<sup>2</sup>** Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.

**<sup>3</sup>** His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence, **<sup>4</sup>** by which He has granted to us precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world through lust.

**<sup>5</sup>** And for this very reason, applying all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, **<sup>6</sup>** and to knowledge self-control, and to self-control perseverance, and to perseverance godliness, **<sup>7</sup>** and to godliness brotherly affection, and to brotherly affection love. **<sup>8</sup>** For if these things are yours and increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. **<sup>9</sup>** For whoever lacks these things is blind, being nearsighted, having forgotten the cleansing from his former sins.

**<sup>10</sup>** Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you practice these things you will never stumble. **<sup>11</sup>** For in this way entrance will be richly supplied to you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

**<sup>12</sup>** Therefore I intend always to remind you of these things, even though you know them and are established in the truth that is present with you. **<sup>13</sup>** I consider it right, as long as I am in this body, to stir you up by way of reminder, **<sup>14</sup>** knowing that the removal of my tent is soon, just as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me. **<sup>15</sup>** And I will also make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.

**<sup>16</sup>** For we did not follow cleverly crafted myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty. **<sup>17</sup>** For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, a voice was borne to Him by the Majestic Glory, “This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” **<sup>18</sup>** We ourselves heard this voice borne from heaven, for we were with Him on the holy mountain.

**<sup>19</sup>** And we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, **<sup>20</sup>** knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from one's own interpretation. **<sup>21</sup>** For no prophecy was ever borne by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. 

## Chapter 2

**<sup>1</sup>** But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves. **<sup>2</sup>** And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of the truth will be blasphemed. **<sup>3</sup>** And in greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction will not be delayed.

**<sup>4</sup>** For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into the Pit and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until judgment; **<sup>5</sup>** and if He did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, along with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; **<sup>6</sup>** and if by turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes He condemned them to ruin, having made them an example of what is coming to the ungodly; **<sup>7</sup>** and if He rescued righteous Lot, who was distressed by the sensual conduct of the lawless **<sup>8</sup>** (for that righteous man, dwelling among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by their lawless deeds that he saw and heard), **<sup>9</sup>** then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment, **<sup>10</sup>** and especially those who go after the flesh in defiling lust and who despise authority, being bold and arrogant, not afraid to slander glorious beings.

**<sup>11</sup>** Whereas angels, though greater in strength and power, do not bring a slanderous judgment against them before the Lord. **<sup>12</sup>** But these, like irrational animals, born as creatures of instinct to be captured and destroyed, slandering what they do not understand, will also be destroyed in their destruction, **<sup>13</sup>** suffering harm as the wage of unrighteousness. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions while they feast with you.

**<sup>14</sup>** They have eyes full of adultery, unceasing in sin, enticing unstable souls. They have hearts trained in greed, children of a curse. **<sup>15</sup>** Forsaking the straight path, they have gone astray. They have followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wage of unrighteousness, **<sup>16</sup>** but he was rebuked for his own transgression: a mute donkey speaking with a human voice restrained the prophet’s madness.

**<sup>17</sup>** These are wells without water and mists driven by a storm, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved. **<sup>18</sup>** For speaking arrogant words of vanity, they entice by sensual desires of the flesh those who are barely escaping from those who live in error. **<sup>19</sup>** Promising them freedom, they themselves are slaves of corruption. For by what a man is overcome, to that he is enslaved.

**<sup>20</sup>** For if after having escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first. **<sup>21</sup>** For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them. **<sup>22</sup>** What has happened to them confirms the true proverb: “A dog returns to its own vomit,” and, “A washed sow returns to wallowing in the mud.” 

## Chapter 3

**<sup>1</sup>** This is now the second letter I am writing to you, beloved. In both of them I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder, **<sup>2</sup>** that you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles.

**<sup>3</sup>** Knowing this first: that in the last days mockers will come with mocking, following after their own lusts **<sup>4</sup>** and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? For ever since the forefathers fell asleep, all things continue just as they were from the beginning of creation.” **<sup>5</sup>** For they deliberately overlook this: that long ago by the word of God the heavens existed, and the earth was formed out of water and through water. **<sup>6</sup>** By these means the world of that time was destroyed, being flooded with water. **<sup>7</sup>** But the present heavens and earth are reserved by the same word for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.

**<sup>8</sup>** But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved: that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. **<sup>9</sup>** The Lord is not slow concerning His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. **<sup>10</sup>** But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements will be dissolved with burning heat, and the earth and the works done on it will be exposed.

**<sup>11</sup>** Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, what kind of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, **<sup>12</sup>** looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and the elements will melt with burning heat? **<sup>13</sup>** But according to His promise, we are looking for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.

**<sup>14</sup>** Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless and blameless. **<sup>15</sup>** And consider the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given to him, **<sup>16</sup>** as he does in all his letters, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable distort, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.

**<sup>17</sup>** You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, guard yourselves so that you are not carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your own steadfastness. **<sup>18</sup>** But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.
