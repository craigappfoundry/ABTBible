# The Book of Judges

## Chapter 1

**<sup>1</sup>** After the death of Joshua, the sons of Israel inquired of the LORD, saying, “Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?” **<sup>2</sup>** And the LORD said, “Judah shall go up. Behold, I have given the land into his hand.” **<sup>3</sup>** Then Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I also will go with you into the territory allotted to you.” So Simeon went with him. **<sup>4</sup>** Judah went up, and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands, and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek.

**<sup>5</sup>** They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek, and fought against him, and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. **<sup>6</sup>** Adoni-bezek fled, and they pursued him and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. **<sup>7</sup>** And Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather scraps under my table. As I have done, so God has repaid me.” And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.

**<sup>8</sup>** Then the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword, and they set the city on fire. **<sup>9</sup>** Afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negev, and in the lowland. **<sup>10</sup>** So Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba), and they struck Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. **<sup>11</sup>** From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir (the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher).

**<sup>12</sup>** And Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him my daughter Achsah as a wife.” **<sup>13</sup>** Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured it; so Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife. **<sup>14</sup>** When she came to him, she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. When she dismounted from her donkey, Caleb said to her, “What do you want?” **<sup>15</sup>** She said to him, “Give me a blessing. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.

**<sup>16</sup>** The descendants of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up from the city of palms with the sons of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the Negev near Arad; and they went and settled with the people there.

**<sup>17</sup>** Then Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah. **<sup>18</sup>** Judah also captured Gaza with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory. **<sup>19</sup>** And the LORD was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country. But he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron. **<sup>20</sup>** And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, and he drove out from there the three sons of Anak.

**<sup>21</sup>** But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have lived with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.

**<sup>22</sup>** Likewise, the house of Joseph went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them. **<sup>23</sup>** The house of Joseph spied out Bethel (the name of the city formerly was Luz). **<sup>24</sup>** And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance to the city, and we will treat you kindly.” **<sup>25</sup>** So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go. **<sup>26</sup>** And the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city and named it Luz, and that is its name to this day.

**<sup>27</sup>** But Manasseh did not take possession of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages. So the Canaanites persisted in living in that land. **<sup>28</sup>** When Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.

**<sup>29</sup>** And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites lived among them in Gezer.

**<sup>30</sup>** Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol, so the Canaanites lived among them and became subject to forced labor.

**<sup>31</sup>** Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon or Ahlab or Achzib or Helbah or Aphik or Rehob. **<sup>32</sup>** So the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out.

**<sup>33</sup>** Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath became forced labor for them.

**<sup>34</sup>** Then the Amorites pressed the sons of Dan into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the valley. **<sup>35</sup>** Yet the Amorites persisted in living in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; but the hand of the house of Joseph grew heavy, and they became subject to forced labor. **<sup>36</sup>** The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward. 

## Chapter 2

**<sup>1</sup>** The angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, “I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land which I swore to your fathers. I said, ‘I will never break My covenant with you, **<sup>2</sup>** and you shall not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed My voice. What is this you have done? **<sup>3</sup>** Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out before you, but they shall become as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.’”

**<sup>4</sup>** When the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept. **<sup>5</sup>** So they called the name of that place Bochim, and they offered sacrifices there to the LORD.

**<sup>6</sup>** When Joshua had dismissed the people, the sons of Israel each went to his inheritance to possess the land. **<sup>7</sup>** The people served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the LORD which He had done for Israel.

**<sup>8</sup>** Then Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of one hundred and ten years. **<sup>9</sup>** They buried him within the boundaries of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.

**<sup>10</sup>** All that generation also were gathered to their fathers, and another generation arose after them who did not know the LORD, nor the work which He had done for Israel.

**<sup>11</sup>** Then the sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals. **<sup>12</sup>** They abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They followed other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed down to them, and they provoked the LORD to anger. **<sup>13</sup>** They forsook the LORD and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.

**<sup>14</sup>** The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He gave them into the hands of those who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies around them, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies. **<sup>15</sup>** Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, just as the LORD had spoken and just as the LORD had sworn to them, so that they were severely distressed.

**<sup>16</sup>** Then the LORD raised up judges who delivered them from the hands of those who plundered them. **<sup>17</sup>** Yet they did not listen to their judges either, for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed down to them. They quickly turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked in obedience to the commandments of the LORD; they did not do what was right.

**<sup>18</sup>** When the LORD raised up judges for them, the LORD was with the judge and saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge, for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed and afflicted them. **<sup>19</sup>** But it came about that when the judge died, they would turn back and act more corruptly than their fathers, going after other gods to serve them and bow down to them. They did not cease from their practices or from their stubborn ways.

**<sup>20</sup>** So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He said, “Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers and has not listened to My voice, **<sup>21</sup>** I in turn will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died, **<sup>22</sup>** in order to test Israel by them, to see whether they will keep the way of the LORD, to walk in it as their fathers did, or not.” **<sup>23</sup>** So the LORD allowed those nations to remain, not driving them out quickly, and He did not give them into the hand of Joshua. 

## Chapter 3

**<sup>1</sup>** These are the nations that the LORD left in order to test Israel by them—that is, all who had not known any of the wars in Canaan. **<sup>2</sup>** He did this only so that the generations of the sons of Israel might be taught war—those who had not experienced it before. **<sup>3</sup>** The five rulers of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath. **<sup>4</sup>** They were left to test Israel by them, to see whether they would obey the commandments of the LORD, which He commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.

**<sup>5</sup>** So the sons of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. **<sup>6</sup>** They took their daughters as wives for themselves and gave their own daughters to their sons, and they served their gods.

**<sup>7</sup>** The sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. They forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs. **<sup>8</sup>** Therefore the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram-naharaim. The sons of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years. **<sup>9</sup>** But when the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the sons of Israel to deliver them—Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother. **<sup>10</sup>** The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram into his hand, so that his hand prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim. **<sup>11</sup>** Then the land had rest for forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.

**<sup>12</sup>** Then the sons of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. So the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the LORD. **<sup>13</sup>** He gathered to himself the sons of Ammon and Amalek, and he went and struck Israel. Then they took possession of the city of palm trees. **<sup>14</sup>** So the sons of Israel served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.

**<sup>15</sup>** But when the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for them—Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The sons of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon king of Moab. **<sup>16</sup>** And Ehud made for himself a sword, double-edged, about a cubit in length, and he strapped it under his clothes on his right thigh. **<sup>17</sup>** He brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. **<sup>18</sup>** When he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried the tribute. **<sup>19</sup>** But he himself turned back at the sculptured stones near Gilgal, and he said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” And he said, “Silence.” So all who were standing around him left.

**<sup>20</sup>** Then Ehud came to him, while he was sitting alone in his cool upper chamber. And Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” So he rose from his seat. **<sup>21</sup>** Then Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly. **<sup>22</sup>** The hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not pull the sword out of his belly—and the refuse came out.

**<sup>23</sup>** Then Ehud went out through the vestibule and shut the doors of the upper chamber behind him and locked them. **<sup>24</sup>** When he had gone out, the servants came, and they saw that the doors of the upper chamber were locked. They said, “He must be relieving himself in the cool room.” **<sup>25</sup>** They waited until they were embarrassed, but still he did not open the doors of the upper chamber. So they took the key and opened them—and there their lord had fallen to the floor, dead.

**<sup>26</sup>** Now Ehud escaped while they were waiting. He passed the sculptured stones and escaped to Seirah. **<sup>27</sup>** When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he led them. **<sup>28</sup>** He said to them, “Follow me, for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and did not allow anyone to cross over.

**<sup>29</sup>** At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all robust and valiant men—not a man escaped. **<sup>30</sup>** So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.

**<sup>31</sup>** After him came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. He also delivered Israel. 

## Chapter 4

**<sup>1</sup>** And the sons of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD after Ehud had died. **<sup>2</sup>** So the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin, king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth Haggoyim. **<sup>3</sup>** Then the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD, for he had nine hundred iron chariots and oppressed the sons of Israel cruelly for twenty years.

**<sup>4</sup>** Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. **<sup>5</sup>** She would sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment. **<sup>6</sup>** She sent and summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and she said to him, “Has not the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded you: ‘Go, march to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men from the sons of Naphtali and from the sons of Zebulun? **<sup>7</sup>** Then I will draw out to you at the Wadi Kishon Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude, and I will give him into your hand.’”

**<sup>8</sup>** But Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.” **<sup>9</sup>** She said, “I will certainly go with you. However, the glory will not be yours on the road you are taking, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.” Then Deborah rose and went with Barak to Kedesh. **<sup>10</sup>** Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and ten thousand men went up at his feet. Deborah also went up with him.

**<sup>11</sup>** Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh.

**<sup>12</sup>** It was reported to Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor. **<sup>13</sup>** So Sisera summoned all his chariots—nine hundred iron chariots—and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Wadi Kishon.

**<sup>14</sup>** Then Deborah said to Barak, “Rise! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sisera into your hand. Has not the LORD gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him. **<sup>15</sup>** And the LORD threw Sisera and all his chariots and all his army into confusion before the edge of the sword of Barak. Sisera dismounted from his chariot and fled on foot. **<sup>16</sup>** But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim, and the entire army of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left.

**<sup>17</sup>** Now Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. **<sup>18</sup>** Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; do not be afraid.” So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. **<sup>19</sup>** Then he said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him. **<sup>20</sup>** Then he said to her, “Stand at the opening of the tent, and if anyone comes and asks you, ‘Is there a man here?’ say, ‘No.’”

**<sup>21</sup>** But Jael, the wife of Heber, took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went down into the ground—while he was fast asleep and exhausted—and he died.

**<sup>22</sup>** And behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man you are seeking.” So he went in with her, and behold, Sisera was lying dead with the tent peg in his temple.

**<sup>23</sup>** So God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the sons of Israel on that day. **<sup>24</sup>** And the hand of the sons of Israel pressed harder and harder against Jabin king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan. 

## Chapter 5

**<sup>1</sup>** Then Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying:

**<sup>2</sup>** “Because the leaders took the lead in Israel,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because the men offered themselves willingly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bless the Lord!<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, to the Lord I will sing;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will sing praise to the Lord, the God of Israel.

**<sup>4</sup>** Lord, when you went out from Seir,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when you marched from the field of Edom,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth trembled, the heavens also poured,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the clouds indeed poured water.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** The mountains quaked before the Lord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the One of Sinai, before the Lord, the God of Israel.

**<sup>6</sup>** In the days of Shamgar son of Anath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the days of Jael, the highways were deserted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and travelers walked by roundabout paths.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** The warriors ceased; they ceased in Israel<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until I, Deborah, arose;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I arose as a mother in Israel.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** They chose new gods;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then war was at the gates.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shield or a spear was not to be seen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among forty thousand in Israel.

**<sup>9</sup>** My heart is with the commanders of Israel,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those who offered themselves willingly among the men.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bless the Lord!<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** Speak, you who ride on white donkeys,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who sit on rich carpets,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you who walk along the way.

**<sup>11</sup>** To the sound of the water-drawers between the watering places,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there they shall recount the righteous acts of the Lord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the righteous deeds of his warriors in Israel.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the people of the Lord went down to the gates.

**<sup>12</sup>** Awake, awake, Deborah!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awake, awake, speak a song!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arise, Barak, and take captive your captors,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O son of Abinoam.

**<sup>13</sup>** Then the remnant of the nobles went down;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people of the Lord went down for me against the mighty.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** From Ephraim their root came down into Amalek;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after you, Benjamin, with your kin.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Machir commanders came down,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from Zebulun those who bear the marshal’s staff.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as was Issachar, so was Barak;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the valley they rushed at his heels.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.

**<sup>16</sup>** Why did you sit among the sheepfolds,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to hear the piping for the flocks?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Dan, why did he linger by the ships?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asher sat still at the seacoast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and remained by his landings.<br/>
**<sup>18</sup>** Zebulun is a people who risked their lives to the death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Naphtali also, on the heights of the field.<br/>
**<sup>19</sup>** The kings came, they fought;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then the kings of Canaan fought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they took no spoil of silver.

**<sup>20</sup>** From the heavens the stars fought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from their courses they fought against Sisera.<br/>
**<sup>21</sup>** The torrent Kishon swept them away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March on, O my soul, with strength!

**<sup>22</sup>** Then the horsehooves pounded<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the galloping, galloping of his mighty ones.<br/>
**<sup>23</sup>** ‘Curse Meroz,’ says the angel of the Lord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘curse bitterly its inhabitants,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they did not come to the help of the Lord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the help of the Lord against the mighty.’

**<sup>24</sup>** Most blessed of women is Jael,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wife of Heber the Kenite,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of tent-dwelling women most blessed.<br/>
**<sup>25</sup>** He asked for water, and she gave him milk;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a princely bowl she brought him curds.<br/>
**<sup>26</sup>** She reached out her hand for the tent peg,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her right hand for the workmen’s mallet;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she struck Sisera, she crushed his head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she shattered and pierced his temple.<br/>
**<sup>27</sup>** Between her feet he sank, he fell, he lay;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between her feet he sank, he fell;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where he sank, there he fell—destroyed.<br/>
**<sup>28</sup>** Through the window she looked out and cried,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mother of Sisera, through the lattice:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Why is his chariot so long in coming?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why tarry the hoofbeats of his chariots?’<br/>
**<sup>29</sup>** Her wisest ladies answer her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed, she repeats the words to herself,<br/>
**<sup>30</sup>** ‘Are they not finding and dividing the spoil?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl, two girls for every man;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spoil of dyed cloth for Sisera,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spoil of dyed cloth embroidered,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dyed cloth embroidered for the neck as spoil?’

**<sup>31</sup>** So may all your enemies perish, O Lord!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But may those who love you be like the rising of the sun in its might.

And the land had rest forty years.

## Chapter 6

**<sup>1</sup>** The sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD gave them into the hand of Midian for seven years. **<sup>2</sup>** The hand of Midian prevailed over Israel. Because of Midian, the sons of Israel made for themselves the dens which are in the mountains, as well as the caves and strongholds. **<sup>3</sup>** For whenever Israel sowed, the Midianites, Amalekites, and the sons of the east would go up against them. **<sup>4</sup>** They would camp against them and destroy the produce of the land as far as Gaza, and they would leave no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep nor ox nor donkey. **<sup>5</sup>** For they came up with their livestock and their tents; they came like a swarm of locusts in number—both they and their camels were without number—and they came into the land to devastate it. **<sup>6</sup>** So Israel was brought very low because of Midian, and the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD.

**<sup>7</sup>** When the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD because of Midian, **<sup>8</sup>** the LORD sent a prophet to the sons of Israel. He said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of slavery. **<sup>9</sup>** I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all your oppressors. I drove them out from before you and gave you their land. **<sup>10</sup>** And I said to you, ‘I am the LORD your God. You shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.’ But you have not obeyed my voice.”

**<sup>11</sup>** Then the angel of the LORD came and sat under the oak that was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites. **<sup>12</sup>** The angel of the LORD appeared to him and said, “The LORD is with you, mighty warrior.” **<sup>13</sup>** But Gideon said to him, “Please, my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His wondrous deeds which our fathers told us about, saying, ‘Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the LORD has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian.” **<sup>14</sup>** And the LORD turned to him and said, “Go in this strength of yours and deliver Israel from the hand of Midian. Have I not sent you?” **<sup>15</sup>** He said to Him, “Please, my lord, how shall I deliver Israel? Look, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.” **<sup>16</sup>** The LORD said to him, “But I will be with you, and you shall strike down Midian as one man.” **<sup>17</sup>** Then he said to Him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is You who speak with me. **<sup>18</sup>** Please do not depart from here until I come back to You and bring out my offering and set it before You.” And He said, “I will stay until you return.”

**<sup>19</sup>** So Gideon went and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and he brought them out to Him under the oak and presented them. **<sup>20</sup>** The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes and place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And he did so. **<sup>21</sup>** Then the angel of the LORD reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. Fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight. **<sup>22</sup>** When Gideon saw that it was the angel of the LORD, he said, “Alas, O Lord GOD! For I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face.” **<sup>23</sup>** But the LORD said to him, “Peace be with you. Do not fear; you shall not die.” **<sup>24</sup>** Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and called it, “The LORD is Peace.” To this day it still stands at Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

**<sup>25</sup>** That night the LORD said to him, “Take your father’s bull, and the second bull seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal which belongs to your father, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it. **<sup>26</sup>** Then build an altar to the LORD your God on top of this stronghold, in an orderly manner, and take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you shall cut down.” **<sup>27</sup>** So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had told him. But because he was too afraid of his father's household and the men of the city to do it by day, he did it at night.

**<sup>28</sup>** When the men of the city got up early in the morning, they saw that the altar of Baal was torn down, the Asherah beside it was cut down, and the second bull had been offered on the altar that had been built. **<sup>29</sup>** And they said to one another, “Who did this thing?” After they investigated and inquired, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash did this thing.” **<sup>30</sup>** Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, so that he may die, for he has torn down the altar of Baal and indeed cut down the Asherah beside it.” **<sup>31</sup>** But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, since someone has torn down his altar.” **<sup>32</sup>** Therefore on that day he was called Jerubbaal, saying, “Let Baal contend against him,” because he had torn down his altar.

**<sup>33</sup>** Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the sons of the east assembled together, and they crossed over and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. **<sup>34</sup>** But the Spirit of the LORD clothed Gideon, and he blew the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called to follow him. **<sup>35</sup>** He sent messengers throughout all of Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him. He also sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.

**<sup>36</sup>** Then Gideon said to God, “If You are going to deliver Israel by my hand, as You have said, **<sup>37</sup>** then see how I am placing a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If dew is on the fleece alone, and all the ground is dry, then I shall know that You will deliver Israel by my hand, as You have said.” **<sup>38</sup>** And it was so. When he got up early the next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water. **<sup>39</sup>** Then Gideon said to God, “Do not let Your anger burn against me. Let me speak just once more. Please let me make just one more test with the fleece: let it now be dry only on the fleece, and let there be dew on all the ground.” **<sup>40</sup>** And God did so that night: it was dry only on the fleece, and there was dew on all the ground. 

## Chapter 7

**<sup>1</sup>** Early in the morning, Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him set up camp beside the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was to the north of them, near the hill of Moreh in the valley.

**<sup>2</sup>** Then the LORD said to Gideon, “The people with you are too many for Me to give Midian into their hand, lest Israel boast against Me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’ **<sup>3</sup>** Now therefore proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home and leave Mount Gilead.’” So twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.

**<sup>4</sup>** But the LORD said to Gideon, “The people are still too many. Bring them down to the water, and I will refine them for you there. And it shall be that of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go with you; but of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.” **<sup>5</sup>** So he brought the people down to the water. And the LORD said to Gideon, “Everyone who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set apart by himself. Likewise, everyone who kneels down to drink.” **<sup>6</sup>** The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men, while all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water.

**<sup>7</sup>** And the LORD said to Gideon, “With the three hundred men who lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hand. Let all the others go, each to his home.” **<sup>8</sup>** So the people took provisions in their hands, and their trumpets. He sent all the men of Israel, every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men. And the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.

**<sup>9</sup>** That same night the LORD said to him, “Arise, go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hand. **<sup>10</sup>** But if you are afraid to go down, go down with Purah your servant **<sup>11</sup>** and listen to what they say; afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down against the camp.” Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the armed men who were in the camp. **<sup>12</sup>** Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the East lay along the valley, as numerous as locusts. And their camels were without number, as many as the sand on the seashore.

**<sup>13</sup>** When Gideon came, he encountered a man recounting a dream to his companion. The man said, “Listen to this, I had a dream, and in it a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian and came to the tent and struck it so that it fell and turned it upside down, so that the tent collapsed.” **<sup>14</sup>** And his companion answered and said, “This is nothing but the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has given Midian and all the camp into his hand.”

**<sup>15</sup>** When Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped. Then he returned to the camp of Israel and said, “Arise, for the LORD has given the camp of Midian into your hand.” **<sup>16</sup>** And he divided the three hundred men into three companies and placed trumpets into the hands of all of them, along with empty jars, with torches inside the jars. **<sup>17</sup>** And he said to them, “Watch me and do likewise. When I come to the edge of the camp, do as I do. **<sup>18</sup>** When I blow the trumpet—I and all who are with me—then you also blow the trumpets on every side of all the camp and shout, ‘For the LORD and for Gideon!’”

**<sup>19</sup>** So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just posted the watch. Then they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands. **<sup>20</sup>** The three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars. They held in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands blew the trumpets. And they cried out, “A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!”

**<sup>21</sup>** Each man stood in his place all around the camp, and all the army panicked, cried out and fled. **<sup>22</sup>** When the three hundred trumpets were blown, the LORD set every man's sword against his companion throughout the whole army. And the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, near Tabbath.

**<sup>23</sup>** And the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali and from Asher and from all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian. **<sup>24</sup>** Then Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters ahead of them, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.” So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they seized the waters as far as Beth-barah and also the Jordan. **<sup>25</sup>** And they captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. Then they pursued Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon across the Jordan. 

## Chapter 8

**<sup>1</sup>** Then the men of Ephraim said to him, “What is this thing you have done to us, not calling us when you went to fight Midian?” And they contended fiercely with him. **<sup>2</sup>** But he said to them, “What have I done today compared to you? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? **<sup>3</sup>** God has given the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, into your hand. What was I able to do compared to you?” Then their anger toward him subsided when he said this.

**<sup>4</sup>** Then Gideon came to the Jordan river and, crossing over—he and the three hundred men who were with him—he was exhausted, yet still in pursuit. **<sup>5</sup>** So he said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who are following me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.” **<sup>6</sup>** But the leaders of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?” **<sup>7</sup>** So Gideon said, “Very well. When the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will flay your flesh with thorns of the wilderness and with briers.” **<sup>8</sup>** From there he went up to Penuel and spoke similarly to them, and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered. **<sup>9</sup>** So he also said to the men of Penuel, “When I return in peace, I will tear down this tower.”

**<sup>10</sup>** Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their army with them, about fifteen thousand men—all who were left of the entire army of the people of the east—for a hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword had fallen. **<sup>11</sup>** And Gideon went up by the route of those who dwell in tents east of Nobah and Jogbehah and struck the army, for the army was off guard. **<sup>12</sup>** Zebah and Zalmunna fled, but he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and he terrified the whole army.

**<sup>13</sup>** Then Gideon, son of Joash, returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres. **<sup>14</sup>** And he captured a young man from the men of Succoth and questioned him. The young man wrote down for him the names of the leaders of Succoth and its elders—seventy-seven men. **<sup>15</sup>** So he came to the men of Succoth and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you mocked me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your exhausted men?’” **<sup>16</sup>** Then he took the elders of the city, and with thorns of the wilderness and with briers he taught the men of Succoth a lesson. **<sup>17</sup>** And he tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.

**<sup>18</sup>** Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?” And they said, “As you are, so were they; each one looked like a king’s son.” **<sup>19</sup>** He said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if you had kept them alive, I would not kill you.” **<sup>20</sup>** Then he said to Jether his firstborn, “Rise, kill them.” But the boy did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, since he was still a boy. **<sup>21</sup>** Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise yourself and strike us, for as the man is, so is his strength.” So Gideon rose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.

**<sup>22</sup>** Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us—you, your son, and your grandson also—for you have saved us from the hand of Midian.” **<sup>23</sup>** But Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the LORD will rule over you.” **<sup>24</sup>** Then Gideon said to them, “Let me make a request of you: that each of you give me an earring from his spoil.” (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) **<sup>25</sup>** And they said, “We will willingly give them.” So they spread out a cloak, and every man threw into it an earring from his spoil. **<sup>26</sup>** The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels of gold, apart from the crescent ornaments and the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and apart from the collars that were on the necks of their camels. **<sup>27</sup>** Gideon made it into an ephod and placed it in his city, in Ophrah. And all Israel prostituted themselves after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his household.

**<sup>28</sup>** So Midian was subdued before the sons of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.

**<sup>29</sup>** Then Jerubbaal son of Joash went and lived in his own house. **<sup>30</sup>** Now Gideon had seventy sons, his own offspring, for he had many wives. **<sup>31</sup>** And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech. **<sup>32</sup>** Then Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

**<sup>33</sup>** And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon died, that the sons of Israel again prostituted themselves after the Baals and made Baal-berith their god. **<sup>34</sup>** And the sons of Israel did not remember the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hand of all their enemies on every side, **<sup>35</sup>** nor did they show loyalty to the house of Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, in return for all the good that he had done to Israel. 

## Chapter 9

**<sup>1</sup>** Abimelek son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem, to his mother’s brothers, and spoke to them and to the whole clan of his mother’s family, saying, **<sup>2</sup>** “Please speak in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem: ‘Which is better for you—that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or that one man rule over you?’ And remember that I am your own flesh and bone.” **<sup>3</sup>** So his mother’s relatives spoke all these words on his behalf in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem, and their hearts inclined toward Abimelek, for they said, “He is our brother.” **<sup>4</sup>** They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple of Baal-berith, with which Abimelek hired worthless and reckless men, and they followed him. **<sup>5</sup>** He went to his father’s house at Ophrah and killed his brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal—seventy men—on one stone. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived, for he hid himself. **<sup>6</sup>** Then all the leaders of Shechem and all Beth-millo gathered together, and they went and made Abimelek king, beside the oak of the pillar that is in Shechem.

**<sup>7</sup>** When Jotham was told, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim and raised his voice and called out. He said to them, “Listen to me, leaders of Shechem, that God may listen to you. **<sup>8</sup>** The trees once went out to anoint a king over themselves, and they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us.’ **<sup>9</sup>** But the olive tree said to them, ‘Shall I give up my fatness, by which gods and men are honored, and go rule over the trees?’ **<sup>10</sup>** Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and reign over us.’ **<sup>11</sup>** But the fig tree said to them, ‘Shall I give up my sweetness and my good fruit and go rule over the trees?’ **<sup>12</sup>** Then the trees said to the vine, ‘You come and reign over us.’ **<sup>13</sup>** But the vine said to them, ‘Shall I give up my wine that cheers gods and men and go rule over the trees?’ **<sup>14</sup>** Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘You come and reign over us.’ **<sup>15</sup>** And the bramble said to the trees, ‘If in truth you are anointing me as king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, let fire come out from the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’

**<sup>16</sup>** “So now, if you have acted in truth and integrity in making Abimelek king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house and have done to him as his hands deserved— **<sup>17</sup>** for my father fought for you and risked his life and rescued you from the hand of Midian, **<sup>18</sup>** but today you have risen against my father’s house and killed his sons—seventy men on one stone—and made Abimelek, the son of his maidservant, king over the leaders of Shechem because he is your brother— **<sup>19</sup>** if, then, you have acted in truth and integrity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, rejoice in Abimelek, and let him also rejoice in you. **<sup>20</sup>** But if not, may fire come out from Abimelek and devour the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo, and may fire come out from the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo and devour Abimelek.” **<sup>21</sup>** Then Jotham fled and ran away and went to Beer, and he lived there out of fear of his brother Abimelek.

**<sup>22</sup>** Abimelek ruled over Israel for three years. **<sup>23</sup>** Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelek and the leaders of Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelek, **<sup>24</sup>** in order that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be avenged, and their blood laid upon Abimelek their brother, who killed them, and on the leaders of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers. **<sup>25</sup>** The leaders of Shechem set ambushers against him on the mountaintops, and they robbed all who passed by them along the road. And it was reported to Abimelek.

**<sup>26</sup>** Now Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers came and moved into Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem put their confidence in him. **<sup>27</sup>** They went out into the field, harvested their vineyards, trod the grapes, and held a festival. They went into the house of their god, ate and drank, and cursed Abimelek. **<sup>28</sup>** Then Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelek, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem! Why should we serve him? **<sup>29</sup>** If only this people were under my authority! Then I would remove Abimelek.” And he said to Abimelek, “Gather your army and come out!”

**<sup>30</sup>** When Zebul the governor of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. **<sup>31</sup>** He secretly sent messengers to Abimelek, saying, “Look, Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem, and they are stirring up the city against you. **<sup>32</sup>** Now, therefore, arise by night, you and the men with you, and lie in wait in the field. **<sup>33</sup>** In the morning, as soon as the sun is up, rise early and rush upon the city; and when he and the men with him come out against you, do to him as your hand finds to do.” **<sup>34</sup>** So Abimelek and all the men who were with him rose by night and laid in wait against Shechem in four companies. **<sup>35</sup>** Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate, and Abimelek and the men with him arose from the ambush. **<sup>36</sup>** When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, men are coming down from the mountaintops.” But Zebul said to him, “You are seeing the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.” **<sup>37</sup>** Gaal spoke again and said, “Look, people are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is coming from the direction of the Diviners’ Oak.” **<sup>38</sup>** Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your mouth now, you who said, ‘Who is Abimelek that we should serve him?’ Are not these the people you despised? Go out now and fight with them.” **<sup>39</sup>** So Gaal went out at the head of the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelek. **<sup>40</sup>** Abimelek chased him, and he fled before him, and many fell wounded up to the entrance of the gate. **<sup>41</sup>** Abimelek stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers so that they could not stay in Shechem.

**<sup>42</sup>** On the next day the people went out into the field, and it was reported to Abimelek. **<sup>43</sup>** He took his men, divided them into three companies, and set an ambush in the field. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he rose against them and struck them. **<sup>44</sup>** Abimelek and the company with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the city gate, while the two other companies rushed upon all who were in the field and struck them. **<sup>45</sup>** Abimelek fought against the city all that day. He captured the city, killed the people who were in it, razed the city, and sowed it with salt.

**<sup>46</sup>** When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered the stronghold of the house of El-berith. **<sup>47</sup>** It was told to Abimelek that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together. **<sup>48</sup>** Abimelek went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the men who were with him, and Abimelek took an axe in his hand, cut down a tree branch, lifted it, and laid it on his shoulder. Then he said to the men with him, “What you saw me do, hurry and do likewise.” **<sup>49</sup>** So all the men also cut down a branch each, and followed Abimelek. They placed them against the stronghold and set the stronghold on fire above them, so that all the men of the Tower of Shechem also died—about a thousand men and women.

**<sup>50</sup>** Then Abimelek went to Thebez and camped against Thebez and captured it. **<sup>51</sup>** But there was a strong tower in the center of the city, and all the men and women and all the leaders of the city fled there and shut themselves in. They went up to the roof of the tower. **<sup>52</sup>** Abimelek came to the tower and fought against it. He approached the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire, **<sup>53</sup>** but a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelek’s head and crushed his skull. **<sup>54</sup>** Then he called quickly to the young man who carried his armor and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, so they will not say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’” So his young man thrust him through, and he died. **<sup>55</sup>** When the men of Israel saw that Abimelek was dead, they each went home.

**<sup>56</sup>** Thus God repaid the evil of Abimelek, which he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers. **<sup>57</sup>** And God also repaid all the evil of the men of Shechem on their heads, and the curse of Jotham son of Jerubbaal came upon the 

## Chapter 10

**<sup>1</sup>** Now after Abimelek, Tola son of Puah, son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to deliver Israel. He dwelt in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim. **<sup>2</sup>** He judged Israel for twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried in Shamir.

**<sup>3</sup>** After him arose Jair the Gileadite, and he judged Israel for twenty-two years. **<sup>4</sup>** He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty towns, which are called Havvoth-jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead. **<sup>5</sup>** Jair died and was buried in Kamon.

**<sup>6</sup>** Then the sons of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. They served the Baals and the Ashtoreths, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines. They forsook the LORD and did not serve Him. **<sup>7</sup>** So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the sons of Ammon. **<sup>8</sup>** That year they crushed and oppressed the sons of Israel for eighteen years—all the sons of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. **<sup>9</sup>** The sons of Ammon also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was greatly distressed.

**<sup>10</sup>** Then the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD, saying, “We have sinned against You, for we have truly forsaken our God and served the Baals.” **<sup>11</sup>** But the LORD said to the sons of Israel, “Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the sons of Ammon, and the Philistines? **<sup>12</sup>** Also when the Sidonians, Amalek, and Maon oppressed you and you cried out to Me, did I not save you from their hand? **<sup>13</sup>** Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods; therefore, I will not deliver you again. **<sup>14</sup>** Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your distress.”

**<sup>15</sup>** Then the sons of Israel said to the LORD, “We have sinned. Do to us whatever seems good in Your sight; only please deliver us this day.” **<sup>16</sup>** So they removed the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD. And His soul could no longer bear the misery of Israel.

**<sup>17</sup>** Then the sons of Ammon were summoned and camped in Gilead. And the sons of Israel gathered themselves and camped in Mizpah. **<sup>18</sup>** The people, the leaders of Gilead, said to one another, “Who is the man who will begin to fight against the sons of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.” 

## Chapter 11

**<sup>1</sup>** Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior. He was the son of a prostitute, and Gilead was his father. **<sup>2</sup>** But Gilead’s wife bore him sons, and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah away. They said to him, “You shall not inherit in our father’s house, for you are the son of another woman.” **<sup>3</sup>** So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob, and worthless men gathered around Jephthah and went out with him.

**<sup>4</sup>** After some time had passed, the Ammonites made war against Israel. **<sup>5</sup>** And when the Ammonites fought against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah back from the land of Tob. **<sup>6</sup>** They said to Jephthah, “Come and be our leader, so that we may fight against the Ammonites.” **<sup>7</sup>** But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Did you not hate me and drive me from my father’s house? Why then have you come to me now when you are in distress?” **<sup>8</sup>** And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “That is why we have now turned to you, so that you may go with us, fight against the Ammonites, and be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.” **<sup>9</sup>** Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you bring me back to fight against the Ammonites, and the LORD gives them into my hand, then I will be your head.” **<sup>10</sup>** And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The LORD shall be witness between us—surely we will do as you have said.” **<sup>11</sup>** So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and leader over them. And Jephthah made vows before the LORD at Mizpah.

**<sup>12</sup>** Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, saying, “What is there between you and me, that you have come to me to make war against my land?” **<sup>13</sup>** And the king of the Ammonites said to Jephthah’s messengers, “Because Israel took away my land when they came up from Egypt—from the Arnon to the Jabbok and to the Jordan river. Now therefore restore those lands peacefully.” **<sup>14</sup>** Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, **<sup>15</sup>** and said to him, “Thus says Jephthah: Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites. **<sup>16</sup>** For when they came up from Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh. **<sup>17</sup>** Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Let us pass through your land,’ but the king of Edom would not listen. They also sent to the king of Moab, but he refused. So Israel remained at Kadesh.

**<sup>18</sup>** Then they journeyed through the wilderness and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab and came to the east side of the land of Moab, and they camped beyond the Arnon. But they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab. **<sup>19</sup>** Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, ‘Let us pass through your land to our place.’ **<sup>20</sup>** But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people and camped at Jahaz, and fought with Israel. **<sup>21</sup>** And the LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them. So Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, who lived in that region. **<sup>22</sup>** And they took possession of all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan river.

**<sup>23</sup>** So then, the LORD, the God of Israel, drove out the Amorites before His people Israel, and will you now possess them? **<sup>24</sup>** Do you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whatever the LORD our God has dispossessed before us, we will possess. **<sup>25</sup>** Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel? Did he ever fight against them? **<sup>26</sup>** While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are along the Arnon, for three hundred years, why did you not recover them during that time? **<sup>27</sup>** Therefore I have not sinned against you, but you are doing me wrong by making war on me. Let the LORD, the Judge, decide today between the sons of Israel and the sons of Ammon.”

**<sup>28</sup>** But the king of the Ammonites did not listen to the words that Jephthah sent to him.

**<sup>29</sup>** Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh and passed on to Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed on to the sons of Ammon. **<sup>30</sup>** And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD and said, “If You will indeed give the sons of Ammon into my hand, **<sup>31</sup>** then whatever comes out from the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon shall be the LORD’s, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.”

**<sup>32</sup>** So Jephthah crossed over to the sons of Ammon to fight against them, and the LORD gave them into his hand. **<sup>33</sup>** And he struck them from Aroer to the entrance of Minnith—twenty cities—and as far as Abel-keramim, with a very great slaughter. So the sons of Ammon were subdued before the sons of Israel.

**<sup>34</sup>** Then Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dancing. She was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter. **<sup>35</sup>** And when he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you have become the cause of great trouble for me. For I have made a vow to the LORD, and I cannot take it back.” **<sup>36</sup>** And she said to him, “My father, you have made a vow to the LORD; do to me according to what you promised, since the LORD has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, the sons of Ammon.” **<sup>37</sup>** Then she said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me: leave me alone for two months, that I may go up and down on the mountains and weep over my virginity, I and my companions.” **<sup>38</sup>** So he said, “Go.” And he sent her away for two months, and she departed—she and her companions—and wept over her virginity on the mountains. **<sup>39</sup>** And at the end of two months she returned to her father, and he did to her according to the vow he had made. She had never known a man. So it became a custom in Israel **<sup>40</sup>** that the daughters of Israel went year by year to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year. 

## Chapter 12

**<sup>1</sup>** Then the men of Ephraim were summoned, and they crossed over to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over to fight against the sons of Ammon and not call us to go with you? We will burn your house down with fire over you!”

**<sup>2</sup>** But Jephthah said to them, “I and my people were in a serious conflict with the sons of Ammon, and I called you for help, but you did not deliver me from their hand. **<sup>3</sup>** When I saw that you would not deliver me, I risked my own life and crossed over against the sons of Ammon, and the LORD gave them into my hand. So why have you come up to me this day to fight against me?”

**<sup>4</sup>** Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. And the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, “You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim—living in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh.”

**<sup>5</sup>** The Gileadites seized the fords of the Jordan opposite Ephraim, and whenever a fugitive of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead would say to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,” **<sup>6</sup>** then they would say to him, “Please say Shibboleth.” But he would say, “Sibboleth,” because he could not pronounce it correctly. Then they would seize him and slaughter him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time forty-two thousand of Ephraim fell.

**<sup>7</sup>** Jephthah judged Israel for six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the towns of Gilead.

**<sup>8</sup>** After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. **<sup>9</sup>** He had thirty sons and thirty daughters; he gave his daughters in marriage outside the clan and brought in thirty daughters from outside for his sons. He judged Israel for seven years. **<sup>10</sup>** Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem.

**<sup>11</sup>** After him, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel. He judged Israel for ten years. **<sup>12</sup>** Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.

**<sup>13</sup>** After him, Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. **<sup>14</sup>** He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkeys. He judged Israel for eight years. **<sup>15</sup>** Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites. 

## Chapter 13

**<sup>1</sup>** And the sons of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD gave them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years.

**<sup>2</sup>** Now there was a certain man from Zorah, from the clan of the Danites, and his name was Manoah. His wife was barren and had borne no children. **<sup>3</sup>** And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, “Behold now, you are barren and have borne no children, but you shall conceive and bear a son. **<sup>4</sup>** Now therefore, be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean. **<sup>5</sup>** For it will happen that you shall conceive and bear a son. No razor shall come upon his head, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.” **<sup>6</sup>** Then the woman went to her husband and said, “A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like that of the angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask him where he was from, and he did not tell me his name. **<sup>7</sup>** But he said to me, ‘It will happen that you shall conceive and bear a son. So now, do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb until the day of his death.’”

**<sup>8</sup>** Then Manoah entreated the LORD and said, “Please, O Lord, let the man of God whom You sent come again to us and teach us what we should do for the boy who is to be born.” **<sup>9</sup>** And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was sitting in the field, but Manoah, her husband, was not with her. **<sup>10</sup>** So the woman hurried and ran and told her husband, “Come quickly, the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me!” **<sup>11</sup>** Then Manoah got up and went after his wife and came to the man and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to the woman?” And he said, “I am.” **<sup>12</sup>** And Manoah said, “Now, when your words come to pass, what shall be the rule for the boy and his manner of life?” **<sup>13</sup>** And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, “Let the woman be careful concerning all that I said to her. **<sup>14</sup>** She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, nor drink wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean. She must observe all that I commanded her.”

**<sup>15</sup>** Then Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, “Please let us detain you, so that we may prepare a young goat for you.” **<sup>16</sup>** But the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, “Though you detain me, I will not eat your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD.” (For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the LORD.) **<sup>17</sup>** And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, “What is your name, so that when your words come to pass, we may honor you?” **<sup>18</sup>** But the angel of the LORD said to him, “Why do you ask my name, seeing it is wonderful?” **<sup>19</sup>** So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering and offered it on the rock to the LORD, and He performed wonders as Manoah and his wife looked on. **<sup>20</sup>** For it came about, when the flame went up from the altar toward heaven, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell on their faces to the ground. **<sup>21</sup>** Now the angel of the LORD did not appear again to Manoah or his wife. Then Manoah knew that it was the angel of the LORD.

**<sup>22</sup>** And Manoah said to his wife, “We shall surely die, for we have seen God.” **<sup>23</sup>** But his wife said to him, “If the LORD had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor shown us all these things, nor let us hear such things as these at this time.”

**<sup>24</sup>** Then the woman gave birth to a son and called his name Samson. And the boy grew, and the LORD blessed him. **<sup>25</sup>** And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol. 

## Chapter 14

**<sup>1</sup>** Samson went down to Timnah, and he saw a woman there among the daughters of the Philistines. **<sup>2</sup>** So he went up and told his father and mother, “I saw a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines. Now get her for me as a wife.”

**<sup>3</sup>** But his father and mother said to him, “Is there no woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people, that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?” But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she is right in my eyes.” **<sup>4</sup>** Now his father and mother did not know that this was from the LORD, for He was seeking an occasion against the Philistines; for at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.

**<sup>5</sup>** Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and when they reached the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him. **<sup>6</sup>** And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and though he had nothing in his hand, he tore the lion apart as one tears a young goat. But he did not tell his father or mother what he had done.

**<sup>7</sup>** Then he went down and spoke to the woman, and she was right in Samson’s eyes. **<sup>8</sup>** After some days he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion. And behold, a swarm of bees was in the body of the lion, and honey. **<sup>9</sup>** So he scraped it out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them and they ate, but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the body of the lion.

**<sup>10</sup>** Then his father went down to the woman, and Samson held a feast there, as was customary for the young men. **<sup>11</sup>** When they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.

**<sup>12</sup>** Samson said to them, “Let me now put a riddle to you. If you can explain it to me within the seven days of the feast and solve it, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes. **<sup>13</sup>** But if you cannot explain it to me, then you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.” And they said to him, “Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it.”

**<sup>14</sup>** So he said to them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Out of the eater came something to eat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and out of the strong came something sweet.”<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they could not solve the riddle for three days.

**<sup>15</sup>** Then on the fourth day they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband, so that he will explain the riddle to us, or we will burn you and your father’s house with fire. Did you invite us here to impoverish us?”

**<sup>16</sup>** So Samson’s wife wept before him and said, “You surely hate me; you do not love me! You have posed a riddle to the sons of my people, but you have not explained it to me.” But he said to her, “Look, I haven’t even explained it to my father or mother—why should I explain it to you?” **<sup>17</sup>** But she wept before him the seven days while their feast lasted, and on the seventh day he told her, because she pressed him hard. Then she explained the riddle to the sons of her people.

**<sup>18</sup>** So on the seventh day, before he went into the bridal chamber, the men of the city said to him,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What is sweeter than honey?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is stronger than a lion?”<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said to them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you had not plowed with my heifer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you would not have solved my riddle.”

**<sup>19</sup>** Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck down thirty men of them, took their spoil, and gave the sets of clothing to those who had explained the riddle. And his anger burned, and he went up to his father’s house. **<sup>20</sup>** But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man. 

## Chapter 15

**<sup>1</sup>** Some time later, during the wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife, bringing a young goat. He said, “I want to go to my wife in her room.” But her father would not let him enter. **<sup>2</sup>** Her father said, “I really thought you thoroughly hated her, so I gave her to your companion. Isn't her younger sister more beautiful? Please take her instead.”

**<sup>3</sup>** But Samson said to them, “This time I will be blameless in regard to the Philistines when I do them harm.” **<sup>4</sup>** So Samson went and caught three hundred foxes. He took torches, tied the foxes tail to tail, and placed one torch between each pair of tails. **<sup>5</sup>** Then he set fire to the torches and released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines. He burned up the shocks, the standing grain, the vineyards, and the olive groves.

**<sup>6</sup>** When the Philistines asked, “Who did this?” they were told, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his companion.” So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father with fire.

**<sup>7</sup>** Then Samson said to them, “If this is how you act, I will not stop until I have taken revenge on you.” **<sup>8</sup>** And he struck them down with a great slaughter, then went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock at Etam.

**<sup>9</sup>** Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah, spreading out in Lehi. **<sup>10</sup>** The men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” They answered, “We have come up to capture Samson, and do to him what he did to us.”

**<sup>11</sup>** So three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock at Etam and said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines rule over us? What have you done to us?” He said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.”

**<sup>12</sup>** They said to him, “We have come down to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.” Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you yourselves will not attack me.”

**<sup>13</sup>** They said to him, “No, we will only tie you up and give you into their hand. We will not kill you.” So they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.

**<sup>14</sup>** When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. Then the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him, and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that has caught fire, and the bindings melted from his hands. **<sup>15</sup>** Noticing a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he reached out and took it, then struck down a thousand men with it. **<sup>16</sup>** Then Samson said, “With the jawbone of a donkey, heap upon heap, with the jawbone of a donkey I have struck down a thousand men.” **<sup>17</sup>** When he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone from his hand; and that place was called Ramath-lehi.

**<sup>18</sup>** Then he became very thirsty and called upon the LORD and said, “You have granted this great deliverance by the hand of your servant, and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?” **<sup>19</sup>** So God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came out of it. He drank, his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore the place was named En-hakkore, which is at Lehi to this day.

**<sup>20</sup>** And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines for twenty years. 

## Chapter 16

**<sup>1</sup>** Samson went to Gaza, and there he saw a prostitute and went in to her. **<sup>2</sup>** The Gazites were told, “Samson has come here,” so they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They kept quiet all night, saying, “At morning light we will kill him.” **<sup>3</sup>** But Samson lay until midnight, and at midnight he arose, took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two gateposts, pulled them up, bar and all, put them on his shoulders, and carried them to the top of the hill that is before Hebron.

**<sup>4</sup>** After this he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. **<sup>5</sup>** And the lords of the Philistines came up to her and said, “Entice him, and see where his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him to subdue him. And we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.” **<sup>6</sup>** So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength lies, and how you might be bound to be subdued.” **<sup>7</sup>** Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, then I shall become weak and be like any other man.” **<sup>8</sup>** Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she bound him with them. **<sup>9</sup>** Now she had men lying in ambush in an inner chamber. And she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he snapped the bowstrings as a strand of flax snaps when it touches fire. So the secret of his strength was not revealed.

**<sup>10</sup>** Then Delilah said to Samson, “Hey, you have mocked me and told me lies! Please tell me how you may be bound.” **<sup>11</sup>** He said to her, “If they bind me with new ropes that have never been used, then I shall become weak and be like any other man.” **<sup>12</sup>** So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And the men lying in ambush were in the inner chamber. But he snapped them off his arms like a thread.

**<sup>13</sup>** Then Delilah said to Samson, “Until now you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me how you may be bound.” And he said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head into loom and fasten it with the pin, then I shall become weak and be like any other man.” **<sup>14</sup>** So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his head and wove them into a loom. Then she fastened it with the pin and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he awoke from his sleep and pulled away the pin, the loom, and the weave.

**<sup>15</sup>** And she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times and have not told me where your great strength lies.” **<sup>16</sup>** And it came about, when she pressed him hard with her words day after day and urged him, that his soul was vexed to the point of death. **<sup>17</sup>** And he finally told her everything and said to her, “A razor has never come upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will leave me, and I shall become weak and be like any other man.”

**<sup>18</sup>** When Delilah saw that he had told her everything, she sent and called the lords of the Philistines, saying, “Come up once more, for he has told me everything.” Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hands. **<sup>19</sup>** She made him sleep on her knees, and she called a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him. **<sup>20</sup>** And she said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And he awoke from his sleep and said, “I will go out as at other times and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him.

**<sup>21</sup>** Then the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes. And they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze chains. And he ground at the mill in the prison. **<sup>22</sup>** But the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.

**<sup>23</sup>** Now the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice. And they said, “Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand.” **<sup>24</sup>** And when the people saw him, they praised their god, for they said, “Our god has given our enemy into our hand, the destroyer of our land, who has killed many of us.”

**<sup>25</sup>** And it came about, when their hearts were merry, that they said, “Call Samson, that he may entertain us.” So they called Samson from the prison, and he entertained them. They made him stand between the pillars. **<sup>26</sup>** And Samson said to the young man who held him by the hand, “Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean against them.” **<sup>27</sup>** Now the house was full of men and women. All the lords of the Philistines were there, and on the roof there were about three thousand men and women who looked on while Samson entertained.

**<sup>28</sup>** Then Samson called to the LORD and said, “O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray, and strengthen me just this once, O God, that I may be avenged on the Philistines for my two eyes.” **<sup>29</sup>** And Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and he leaned his weight against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other. **<sup>30</sup>** And Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines.” Then he bowed with all his strength, and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those he had killed during his life.

**<sup>31</sup>** Then his brothers and all his father’s household came down and took him, and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had judged Israel for twenty years. 

## Chapter 17

**<sup>1</sup>** There was a man from the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah. **<sup>2</sup>** He said to his mother, “The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse and spoke of it in my hearing—look, the silver is with me; I took it.” And his mother said, “May you be blessed by the LORD, my son.”

**<sup>3</sup>** So he returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother. Then his mother said, “I dedicate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a cast idol. So now I will return it to you.”

**<sup>4</sup>** When he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who made them into a carved image and a cast idol. And it was in Micah’s house. **<sup>5</sup>** Now the man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and household gods, and he ordained one of his sons, who became his priest.

**<sup>6</sup>** In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.

**<sup>7</sup>** Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, from the tribe of Judah. He was a Levite and was sojourning there. **<sup>8</sup>** The man left the city of Bethlehem in Judah to find a place to stay wherever he might. As he traveled, he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah.

**<sup>9</sup>** Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he said to him, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am traveling to find a place to stay.”

**<sup>10</sup>** Micah said to him, “Stay with me and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year, a set of clothes, and your provisions.” So the Levite went in.

**<sup>11</sup>** The Levite agreed to stay with the man, and the young man became like one of his sons. **<sup>12</sup>** Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in Micah’s house. **<sup>13</sup>** Then Micah said, “Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, since I have a Levite as priest.” 

## Chapter 18

**<sup>1</sup>** In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking for itself an inheritance to dwell in, for until that day no inheritance had fallen to them among the tribes of Israel. **<sup>2</sup>** So the sons of Dan sent out five men from their whole number, men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to explore it. And they said to them, “Go and explore the land.” And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and spent the night there. **<sup>3</sup>** When they were near the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite, so they turned aside and said to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?” **<sup>4</sup>** He said to them, “Thus and so Micah has done for me—he has hired me and I have become his priest.” **<sup>5</sup>** And they said to him, “Please inquire of God, that we may know whether the way we are going will succeed.” **<sup>6</sup>** And the priest said to them, “Go in peace. The LORD is watching over your journey.”

**<sup>7</sup>** Then the five men went on and came to Laish. They saw that the people who were in it lived securely, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting, lacking nothing in the land and possessing wealth. They were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone. **<sup>8</sup>** When they came back to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them, “What did you find?” **<sup>9</sup>** And they said, “Arise, let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. Will you sit still? Do not delay to go, to enter and possess the land. **<sup>10</sup>** When you go, you will come to a people living securely, and the land is spacious. For God has given it into your hand—a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth.”

**<sup>11</sup>** So six hundred men from the clan of the Danites set out from Zorah and Eshtaol, armed with weapons of war. **<sup>12</sup>** They went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. Therefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan to this day; it is west of Kiriath-jearim. **<sup>13</sup>** From there they passed on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah.

**<sup>14</sup>** Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land of Laish said to their brothers, “Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod, household gods, a carved image, and a cast image? Now therefore, consider what you will do.” **<sup>15</sup>** They turned aside there and came to the house of the young Levite at the home of Micah and greeted him. **<sup>16</sup>** Now the six hundred men of the Danites, armed with their weapons of war, stood at the entrance of the gate. **<sup>17</sup>** And the five men who had gone to spy out the land went up and entered there. They took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the cast image, while the priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed for war. **<sup>18</sup>** When these went into Micah’s house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the cast image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?” **<sup>19</sup>** They said to him, “Be quiet. Put your hand over your mouth and come with us. Be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man or to be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?” **<sup>20</sup>** And the priest’s heart was glad. He took the ephod, the household gods, and the carved image and went along with the people.

**<sup>21</sup>** They turned and departed, placing the little ones, the livestock, and the goods in front of them. **<sup>22</sup>** When they had gone some distance from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house were called out, and they overtook the sons of Dan. **<sup>23</sup>** They shouted to the sons of Dan, who turned around and said to Micah, “What is the matter with you, that you have assembled together?” **<sup>24</sup>** And he said, “You took away my gods that I made, and the priest, and went away, and what do I have left? How then do you say to me, ‘What is the matter with you?’” **<sup>25</sup>** And the sons of Dan said to him, “Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry men fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household.” **<sup>26</sup>** Then the sons of Dan went on their way, and Micah saw that they were too strong for him. So he turned and went back to his house.

**<sup>27</sup>** But they took what Micah had made, and the priest who had belonged to him, and they came to Laish, to a quiet and unsuspecting people. They struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire. **<sup>28</sup>** There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth-rehob. They rebuilt the city and lived in it. **<sup>29</sup>** And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel. But the name of the city was formerly Laish.

**<sup>30</sup>** And the sons of Dan set up for themselves the carved image. And Jonathan the son of Gershom, son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land. **<sup>31</sup>** So they set up for themselves the carved image that Micah had made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh. 

## Chapter 19

**<sup>1</sup>** Now in those days, when there was no king in Israel, there was a certain Levite residing as a foreigner in the remote areas of the hill country of Ephraim. He took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah. **<sup>2</sup>** But his concubine was unfaithful to him and left him, going to her father's house in Bethlehem of Judah, where she stayed for four months. **<sup>3</sup>** Then her husband arose and went after her to speak kindly to her and bring her back. He had with him his servant and a pair of donkeys. When he arrived at her father’s house, the young woman brought him into the house, and her father rejoiced to meet him. **<sup>4</sup>** His father-in-law, the young woman’s father, persuaded him to stay, and he remained with him three days. They ate, drank, and lodged there. **<sup>5</sup>** On the fourth day, they got up early in the morning, and he prepared to leave. But the young woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Refresh yourself with a bit of food, and afterward you may go.” **<sup>6</sup>** So the two of them sat down, and they ate and drank together. Then the young woman’s father said, “Please, be willing to stay overnight and let your heart be merry.” **<sup>7</sup>** When the man stood up to leave, his father-in-law urged him, and he spent the night there again. **<sup>8</sup>** On the fifth day, he arose early in the morning to leave. But the young woman’s father said, “Refresh yourself.” So they delayed until the day was far gone, and the two of them ate together. **<sup>9</sup>** When the man got up to leave—he, his concubine, and his servant—his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, said to him, “Look, the day has drawn to a close. Please spend the night. Look, the day is coming to an end. Stay here tonight and let your heart be merry. Tomorrow you can get up early and go on your way home.” **<sup>10</sup>** But the man was unwilling to stay another night. So he rose and departed, and came to a place opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his pair of saddled donkeys and his concubine with him. **<sup>11</sup>** As they were near Jebus, the day was nearly gone. The servant said to his master, “Come now, let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it.” **<sup>12</sup>** But his master said to him, “We will not turn aside into a city of foreigners, who are not of the sons of Israel; we will pass on to Gibeah.” **<sup>13</sup>** And he said to his servant, “Come, let us approach one of these places, and we will spend the night in Gibeah or in Ramah.” **<sup>14</sup>** So they passed on and went their way, and the sun set upon them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin. **<sup>15</sup>** They turned aside there to go in and lodge at Gibeah. When he entered, he sat down in the open square of the city, for no man took them into his house to spend the night. **<sup>16</sup>** Then behold, an old man was coming in from his work in the field that evening. He was also from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was residing in Gibeah, but the men of the place were Benjaminites. **<sup>17</sup>** When he looked up and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man said, “Where are you going, and where do you come from?” **<sup>18</sup>** And he said to him, “We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, from which I am. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and now I am going to the house of the LORD, but no man has taken me into his house. **<sup>19</sup>** We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and also bread and wine for me, your servant, and for the young woman and the servant who is with your servant; there is no lack of anything.” **<sup>20</sup>** The old man said, “Peace be to you. I will take care of all your needs—only do not spend the night in the square.” **<sup>21</sup>** So he brought him into his house and gave the donkeys fodder. Then they washed their feet, ate, and drank.

**<sup>22</sup>** While they were enjoying themselves, behold, certain worthless men of the city surrounded the house. They pounded on the door and said to the old man, the master of the house, “Bring out the man who came into your house so we can have relations with him.” **<sup>23</sup>** The man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, “No, my brothers, do not act so wickedly. Since this man has come into my house, do not do this disgraceful thing. **<sup>24</sup>** Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. Let me bring them out to you now; abuse them and do to them whatever you please. But do not commit such an outrageous act against this man.” **<sup>25</sup>** But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and brought her out to them. They raped her and abused her all night until morning. At dawn, they let her go. **<sup>26</sup>** As morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the entrance of the man’s house where her master was, and lay there until it was light. **<sup>27</sup>** Her master arose in the morning, opened the doors of the house, and went out to go on his way. And behold, the woman, his concubine, was lying at the entrance of the house, with her hands on the threshold. **<sup>28</sup>** He said to her, “Get up, let us go.” But there was no answer. So he placed her on the donkey, and the man rose up and went to his home.

**<sup>29</sup>** When he entered his house, he took a knife and laid hold of his concubine. He cut her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel. **<sup>30</sup>** And everyone who saw it said, “Nothing like this has happened or been seen from the day the sons of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day. Consider it, take counsel, and speak.” 

## Chapter 20

**<sup>1</sup>** Then all the sons of Israel went out, and the congregation assembled as one man  to the LORD at Mizpah, coming from Dan to Beersheba, including from the land of Gilead. **<sup>2</sup>** And the chiefs of all the people, all the tribes of Israel, took their stand in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand men on foot who drew the sword. **<sup>3</sup>** (Now the sons of Benjamin heard that the sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the sons of Israel said, "Tell us, how did this evil happen?"

**<sup>4</sup>** So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered and said, "I came with my concubine to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, to spend the night. **<sup>5</sup>** And the masters of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house against me by night; they thought to kill me, and they violated my concubine so that she died. **<sup>6</sup>** Then I took my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel’s inheritance, because they committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel. **<sup>7</sup>** And now, all you sons of Israel, give here your counsel and advice."

**<sup>8</sup>** So all the people rose as one man, saying, "Not one of us will go to his tent, and not one of us will turn aside to his house. **<sup>9</sup>** But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot. **<sup>10</sup>** And we will take ten men out of every hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to provide provisions for the people, that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, they may repay all the disgrace which they have committed in Israel." **<sup>11</sup>** In this way, all the men of Israel gathered against the city, united as one man.

**<sup>12</sup>** Then the tribes of Israel sent men throughout the entire tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What is this wickedness that has taken place among you? **<sup>13</sup>** Now then, deliver up the men, the worthless fellows in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and remove evil from Israel." But the sons of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the sons of Israel. **<sup>14</sup>** And the sons of Benjamin gathered from the cities to Gibeah to go out to battle against the sons of Israel. **<sup>15</sup>** From the cities, on that day, the sons of Benjamin were mustered: twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, apart from the inhabitants of Gibeah, who mustered seven hundred choice men. **<sup>16</sup>** Among all these were seven hundred choice men left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.

**<sup>17</sup>** Then the men of Israel, apart from Benjamin, were mustered: four hundred thousand men who drew the sword; all of them men of war.

**<sup>18</sup>** And the sons of Israel arose and went up to Bethel, and inquired of God, saying, "Who shall go up first for us to battle against the sons of Benjamin?" And the LORD said, "Judah first." **<sup>19</sup>** So the sons of Israel rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah. **<sup>20</sup>** And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel arranged for battle against them at Gibeah.

**<sup>21</sup>** Then the sons of Benjamin came out from Gibeah and struck down on that day twenty-two thousand men of Israel to the ground. **<sup>22</sup>** But the people, the men of Israel, strengthened themselves and again formed the battle line in the place where they had formed it the first day. **<sup>23</sup>** And the sons of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall we again draw near for battle against our brothers, the sons of Benjamin?" And the LORD said, "Go up against him."

**<sup>24</sup>** So the sons of Israel came near to the sons of Benjamin on the second day. **<sup>25</sup>** And Benjamin went out from Gibeah against them the second day and struck down to the ground again eighteen thousand men of the sons of Israel; all these drew the sword.

**<sup>26</sup>** Then all the sons of Israel, and all the people, went up and came to Bethel and wept, and they sat there before the LORD and fasted that day until evening. And they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. **<sup>27</sup>** And the sons of Israel inquired of the LORD (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, **<sup>28</sup>** and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it to minister in those days), saying, "Shall we yet again go out to battle against our brothers, the sons of Benjamin, or shall we cease?" And the LORD said, "Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand."

**<sup>29</sup>** So Israel set men in ambush against Gibeah all around. **<sup>30</sup>** And the sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day and arrayed themselves against Gibeah as at other times.

**<sup>31</sup>** And the sons of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city, and they began to strike and kill some of the people as at other times on the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, and in the field about thirty men of Israel. **<sup>32</sup>** And the sons of Benjamin said, "They are struck down before us as at the first." But the sons of Israel said, "Let us flee so that we may draw them away from the city to the highways."

**<sup>33</sup>** Then all the men of Israel rose from their place and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar, and the men of Israel in ambush rushed out of their place from Maareh-geba. **<sup>34</sup>** And ten thousand choice men from all Israel came against Gibeah, and the battle was fierce; but the Benjaminites did not know that disaster was close upon them. **<sup>35</sup>** And the LORD struck Benjamin before Israel, and the sons of Israel destroyed twenty-five thousand one hundred men of Benjamin that day; all of these drew the sword. **<sup>36</sup>** So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. When the men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin because they trusted in the ambush which they had set against Gibeah, **<sup>37</sup>** the ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah; and the ambush drew up and struck the whole city with the edge of the sword.

**<sup>38</sup>** Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise from the city. **<sup>39</sup>** When the men of Israel turned in battle, Benjamin began to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel, for they said, "Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle."

**<sup>40</sup>** But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, Benjamin looked behind them, and they saw the whole city was going up in smoke to heaven. **<sup>41</sup>** Then the men of Israel turned back, and the men of Benjamin were terrified, for they saw that disaster had overtaken them. **<sup>42</sup>** Therefore they turned before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them, and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of them.

**<sup>43</sup>** They surrounded Benjamin, pursued them without rest, and trod them down opposite Gibeah toward the east. **<sup>44</sup>** Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all of these were valiant warriors. **<sup>45</sup>** Then they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, but they gleaned five thousand men of them on the highways and overtook them at Gidom and struck down two thousand men of them.

**<sup>46</sup>** So all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these were valiant men. **<sup>47</sup>** But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they stayed at the rock of Rimmon for four months. **<sup>48</sup>** And the men of Israel turned back against the sons of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the men of every city and the cattle and all that was found. Also they set on fire all the cities which they found. 

## Chapter 21

**<sup>1</sup>** Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, “None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin for a wife.” **<sup>2</sup>** So the people came to Bethel and sat there before God until evening, and they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly. **<sup>3</sup>** And they said, “O LORD, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that one tribe should be missing today from Israel?” **<sup>4</sup>** And it came about the next day that the people rose early and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.

**<sup>5</sup>** Then the sons of Israel said, “Who among all the tribes of Israel did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah?” For they had taken a great oath concerning anyone who did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah, saying, “He shall surely be put to death.” **<sup>6</sup>** And the sons of Israel were sorry for their brother Benjamin, and said, “Today one tribe has been cut off from Israel. **<sup>7</sup>** What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since we have sworn by the LORD not to give them any of our daughters as wives?”

**<sup>8</sup>** And they said, “What one is there of the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah?” And behold, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly. **<sup>9</sup>** For when the people were counted, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there. **<sup>10</sup>** So the congregation sent twelve thousand of the valiant men there and commanded them, saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and the little ones. **<sup>11</sup>** This is the thing you shall do: you shall devote every male and every woman who has lain with a man to destruction.” **<sup>12</sup>** And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.

**<sup>13</sup>** Then the whole congregation sent and spoke to the sons of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them. **<sup>14</sup>** And Benjamin returned at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jabesh-gilead; but even so, they were not enough for them.

**<sup>15</sup>** And the people were sorry for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel. **<sup>16</sup>** Then the elders of the congregation said, “What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?” **<sup>17</sup>** And they said, “There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe may not be wiped out from Israel. **<sup>18</sup>** But we cannot give them wives from our daughters, for the sons of Israel have sworn, saying, ‘Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.’” **<sup>19</sup>** And they said, “Behold, there is a feast of the LORD from year to year in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.”

**<sup>20</sup>** And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, “Go and lie in wait in the vineyards, **<sup>21</sup>** and watch; and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then come out of the vineyards, and each of you seize his wife from among the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. **<sup>22</sup>** And it shall come about, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we shall say to them, ‘Grant them to us as a favor, because we did not take a wife for each of them in battle, nor did you yourselves give them to them, otherwise you would now be guilty.’”

**<sup>23</sup>** So the sons of Benjamin did so, and took wives according to their number from the dancers whom they carried off; and they went and returned to their inheritance, and rebuilt the cities and lived in them. **<sup>24</sup>** And the sons of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family; and each went out from there to his inheritance.

**<sup>25</sup>** In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
