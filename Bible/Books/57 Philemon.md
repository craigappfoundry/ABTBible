# The Epistle of Paul to Philemon

## Chapter 1

**<sup>1</sup>** Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow worker, **<sup>2</sup>** and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your house: **<sup>3</sup>** Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

**<sup>4</sup>** I give thanks to my God always when I remember you in my prayers, **<sup>5</sup>** because I hear of your love and the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints, **<sup>6</sup>** so that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ. **<sup>7</sup>** For I have had much joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.

**<sup>8</sup>** Therefore, though I have much boldness in Christ to command you to do what is proper, **<sup>9</sup>** yet for love’s sake I appeal to you—being such a one as Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus— **<sup>10</sup>** I appeal to you concerning my child Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment, **<sup>11</sup>** who formerly was useless to you but now is useful both to you and to me. **<sup>12</sup>** I am sending him back to you, that is, my very heart, **<sup>13</sup>** whom I wanted to keep with me, so that on your behalf he might serve me in my imprisonment for the gospel.

**<sup>14</sup>** But without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness might not be by compulsion but by free will. **<sup>15</sup>** For perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a time, so that you might have him back forever, **<sup>16</sup>** no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.

**<sup>17</sup>** If, then, you consider me a partner, receive him as you would me. **<sup>18</sup>** And if he has wronged you in anything or owes you anything, charge that to my account.

**<sup>19</sup>** I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it. Not to mention that you owe me your very self besides. **<sup>20</sup>** Yes, brother, may I have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.

**<sup>21</sup>** Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. **<sup>22</sup>** And at the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.

**<sup>23</sup>** Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, **<sup>24</sup>** as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.

**<sup>25</sup>** The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
