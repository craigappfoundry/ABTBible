# The Song of Solomon

## Chapter 1

**<sup>1</sup>** The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s.

**<sup>2</sup>** Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your love is better than wine.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** Your oils have a pleasing fragrance;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your name is poured-out oil;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore the maidens love you.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** Draw me after you—let us run!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king has brought me into his chambers.

We will rejoice and be glad in you;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will praise your love more than wine.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rightly do they love you.

**<sup>5</sup>** I am black but beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like the tents of Kedar,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like the curtains of Solomon.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** Do not gaze at me because I am dark,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because the sun has scorched me.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother’s sons were angry with me;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they made me keeper of the vineyards,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but my own vineyard I have not kept.

**<sup>7</sup>** Tell me, you whom my soul loves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where you pasture your flock, where you make it lie down at noon;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for why should I be like one who veils herself beside the flocks of your companions?

**<sup>8</sup>** If you do not know, most beautiful among women,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go forth in the footsteps of the flock and pasture your young goats beside the shepherds’ tents.

**<sup>9</sup>** To a mare among Pharaoh’s chariots I compare you, my darling. **<sup>10</sup>** Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your neck with strings of beads.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** We will make for you ornaments of gold with studs of silver.

**<sup>12</sup>** While the king was at his table,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my perfume gave forth its fragrance.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** My beloved is to me a pouch of myrrh<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that lies all night between my breasts.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of En-Gedi.

**<sup>15</sup>** Behold, you are beautiful, my darling;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, you are beautiful;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your eyes are like doves.

**<sup>16</sup>** Behold, you are handsome, my beloved, indeed pleasant.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our couch is luxuriant.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** The beams of our house are cedars;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our rafters, cypresses.<br/>


## Chapter 2

**<sup>1</sup>** I am a rose of Sharon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a lily of the valleys.

**<sup>2</sup>** Like a lily among thorns,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so is my darling among the daughters.

**<sup>3</sup>** Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so is my beloved among the young men.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his shade I delighted to sit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his fruit was sweet to my taste.

**<sup>4</sup>** He brought me into the house of wine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his banner over me was love.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** Sustain me with raisin cakes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;refresh me with apples,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I am sick with love.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** His left hand is under my head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his right hand embraces me.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the gazelles or by the does of the field,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you not arouse or awaken love until it pleases.

**<sup>8</sup>** The voice of my beloved!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, he is coming,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaping on the mountains,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bounding over the hills.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, he is standing behind our wall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looking through the windows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peering through the lattice.

**<sup>10</sup>** My beloved responded and said to me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** For the winter has passed;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rain is over and gone.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** The blossoms have appeared in the land,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the time of singing has come,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** The fig tree ripens its figs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the vines in blossom give forth fragrance.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come away.”

**<sup>14</sup>** O my dove, in the clefts of the rock,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the hiding place of the cliff,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let me see your face, let me hear your voice;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for your voice is sweet, and your appearance is lovely.

**<sup>15</sup>** Catch the foxes for us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the little foxes that are ruining the vineyards,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for our vineyards are in blossom.

**<sup>16</sup>** My beloved is mine and I am his;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he pastures his flock among the lilies.<br/>
**<sup>17</sup>** Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be like a gazelle or a young stag on the cleft mountains.<br/>


## Chapter 3

**<sup>1</sup>** On my bed by night I sought him whom my soul loves;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sought him but did not find him.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** I will rise now and go about the city, in the streets and in the squares;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him but did not find him.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** The watchmen who go about the city found me:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Have you seen him whom my soul loves?”<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** Scarcely had I passed them when I found him whom my soul loves.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I held him and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mother's house,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the chamber of her who conceived me.

**<sup>5</sup>** I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the gazelles or the does of the field,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not to stir up or awaken love until it pleases.

**<sup>6</sup>** Who is this coming up from the wilderness like columns of smoke,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with all the fragrant powders of the merchant?<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** Behold, it is Solomon’s litter!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around it are sixty mighty men,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the mighty men of Israel,<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** all of them armed with swords and expert in war,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each with his sword at his thigh, against fear in the night.<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** King Solomon made himself a carriage from the wood of Lebanon. **<sup>10</sup>** He made its posts of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its interior was inlaid with love by the daughters of Jerusalem.

**<sup>11</sup>** Go out, O daughters of Zion, and look upon King Solomon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the day of the gladness of his heart.<br/>


## Chapter 4

**<sup>1</sup>** Behold, you are beautiful, my darling;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, you are beautiful.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your eyes are doves behind your veil.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your hair is like a flock of goats<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that descend from Mount Gilead.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that have come up from the washing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all of which bear twins,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and none among them has lost her young.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** Your lips are like a scarlet thread,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your mouth is lovely.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your cheeks behind your veil are like halves of a pomegranate.<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** Your neck is like the tower of David,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;built in rows of stone;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on it hang a thousand shields,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all of them shields of warriors.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that graze among the lilies.

**<sup>6</sup>** Until the day breathes and the shadows flee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** You are altogether beautiful, my darling;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is no blemish in you.

**<sup>8</sup>** Come with me from Lebanon, my bride;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come with me from Lebanon.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depart from the peak of Amana,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the summit of Senir and Hermon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the dens of lions,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the mountains of leopards.

**<sup>9</sup>** You have captured my heart, my sister, my bride;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have captured my heart with one glance of your eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with one jewel of your necklace.<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much better is your love than wine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the fragrance of your oils than all spices!<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** Your lips drip nectar, my bride;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honey and milk are under your tongue;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the scent of your garments is like the scent of Lebanon.

**<sup>12</sup>** A locked garden is my sister, my bride,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a locked spring, a sealed fountain.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with choice fruits, henna with nard,<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with all the chief spices—<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** a garden spring, a well of living water,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and flowing streams from Lebanon.

**<sup>16</sup>** Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blow upon my garden, let its fragrance be wafted abroad.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let my beloved come to his garden and eat its choicest fruits.<br/>


## Chapter 5

**<sup>1</sup>** I have come to my garden, my sister, my bride;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have gathered my myrrh with my spice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have drunk my wine with my milk.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eat, friends; drink and be drunk with love.

**<sup>2</sup>** I was asleep, but my heart was awake.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of my beloved knocking:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my perfect one,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for my head is filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.”<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** I had taken off my garment; how could I put it on again?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had washed my feet; how could I soil them again?<br/>
**<sup>4</sup>** My beloved put his hand through the opening,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my heart was stirred for him.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** I arose to open to my beloved,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my hands dripped with myrrh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my fingers with flowing myrrh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the handles of the bolt.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had turned away and was gone.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul failed when he spoke.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sought him, but did not find him;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I called him, but he gave no answer.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they struck me, they wounded me;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the guards on the walls took my cloak from me.<br/>
**<sup>8</sup>** I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you find my beloved, that you tell him I am faint with love.

**<sup>9</sup>** What is your beloved more than another beloved,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O most beautiful among women?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is your beloved more than another beloved, that you so charge us?

**<sup>10</sup>** My beloved is radiant and ruddy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distinguished among ten thousand.<br/>
**<sup>11</sup>** His head is pure gold; his locks are wavy, black as a raven. **<sup>12</sup>** His eyes are like doves beside streams of water,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bathed in milk, set like jewels.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** His cheeks are like beds of spice yielding fragrance;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his lips are lilies, dripping flowing myrrh.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** His arms are rods of gold, set with beryl;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his body is polished ivory, overlaid with sapphires.<br/>
**<sup>15</sup>** His legs are pillars of alabaster, set on pedestals of fine gold.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars.<br/>
**<sup>16</sup>** His mouth is sweetness itself; he is altogether desirable.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.<br/>


## Chapter 6

**<sup>1</sup>** Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?

**<sup>2</sup>** My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to graze in the gardens and to gather lilies.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he grazes among the lilies.

**<sup>4</sup>** You are beautiful as Tirzah, my darling,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lovely as Jerusalem, awe-inspiring as bannered hosts.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** Turn your eyes away from me, for they overwhelm me.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from Gilead.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** Your teeth are like a flock of ewes coming up from the washing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all of them bearing twins, and not one among them has lost her young.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** Like a slice of pomegranate is your temple behind your veil. **<sup>8</sup>** There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and maidens without number, **<sup>9</sup>** but my dove, my perfect one, is unique—she is the only one of her mother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the favorite of her who bore her.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daughters saw her and called her blessed;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the queens and concubines praised her:

**<sup>10</sup>** “Who is this that looks forth like the dawn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fair as the moon, clear as the sun,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awe-inspiring as bannered hosts?”

**<sup>11</sup>** I went down to the grove of nut trees to see the blossoms of the valley,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to see whether the vine had budded, whether the pomegranates were in bloom.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** Before I knew it, my soul had set me among the chariots of my noble people.

**<sup>13</sup>** Return, return, O Shulammite! Return, return, that we may look upon you.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should you look upon the Shulammite, as upon the dance of Mahanaim?<br/>


## Chapter 7

**<sup>1</sup>** How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O noble daughter!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curves of your hips are like ornaments, the work of a master’s hand.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** Your navel is a rounded bowl that never lacks mixed wine;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your belly is a heap of wheat, encircled with lilies.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.

**<sup>4</sup>** Your neck is like a tower of ivory;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your eyes are pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, which looks toward Damascus.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** Your head crowns you like Carmel, and the flowing locks of your head are like purple;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a king is held captive in the tresses.

**<sup>6</sup>** How beautiful and how pleasant you are, O love, with your delights! **<sup>7</sup>** Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters. **<sup>8</sup>** I said, “I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit stalks.”<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May your breasts be like clusters of the vine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the scent of your breath like apples,<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** and your mouth like the best wine.

It goes down smoothly for my beloved,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gliding over lips and teeth.**<sup>10</sup>** I am my beloved’s, and his desire is for me.

**<sup>11</sup>** Come, my beloved, let us go out into the field;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let us lodge in the villages.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** Let us go out early to the vineyards;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let us see whether the vine has budded,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether the blossoms have opened,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the pomegranates are in bloom.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There I will give you my love.<br/>
**<sup>13</sup>** The mandrakes give off fragrance,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and at our doors are all kinds of precious fruits,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new as well as old,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.<br/>


## Chapter 8

**<sup>1</sup>** Oh, that you were like a brother to me, who nursed at my mother's breasts!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I found you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** I would lead you and bring you into the house of my mother—she who taught me.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would give you spiced wine to drink, the juice of my pomegranate.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me. **<sup>4</sup>** I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases.

**<sup>5</sup>** Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the apple tree I awakened you;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there your mother was in labor with you;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there she who bore you was in labor.

**<sup>6</sup>** Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for love is strong as death, jealousy is fierce as the grave.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its flashes are flashes of fire, the very flame of the LORD.<br/>
**<sup>7</sup>** Many waters cannot quench love, nor can floods drown it.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a man offered all the wealth of his house for love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he would be utterly despised.

**<sup>8</sup>** We have a little sister, and she has no breasts.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What shall we do for our sister on the day when she is spoken for?<br/>
**<sup>9</sup>** If she is a wall, we will build upon her a turret of silver;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.<br/>
**<sup>10</sup>** I was a wall, and my breasts were like towers;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then I was in his eyes as one who finds peace.

**<sup>11</sup>** Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he let out the vineyard to keepers;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each one was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit.<br/>
**<sup>12</sup>** My vineyard, my very own, is before me;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, O Solomon, may have the thousand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the keepers of the fruit two hundred.

**<sup>13</sup>** You who dwell in the gardens, companions are listening for your voice;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let me hear it.<br/>
**<sup>14</sup>** Make haste, my beloved, and be like a gazelle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a young stag on the mountains of spices.<br/>
