## Translation Notes

### Who?

Who made this translation? I did. I am Allyn Craig. It wasn't created by committee. It was just me. Although I will say up front that I had (a lot of) assistance from AI translation tools (mostly ChatGPT).

I know Biblical Greek fairly well. I can read most New Testament verses and understand them without much assistance. There are some finer points of grammar, and some of the more uncommon Greek words that I might not be familiar with. Generally I don't need much assistance with reading and translating from Greek. It's just tedious work - so I used ChatGPT for a lot of the translation work, relying on my knowledge of Greek to polish the text. After all, ChatGPT is good, but it's not **that** good.

I know Hebrew rather less than Greek. I do know Hebrew enough that I can follow along the simpler narrative passages. But in the case of the Old Testament, I did rely on ChatGPT a lot more than with the New Testament. Even then, I did make extensive use of online tools like [Blue Letter Bible](http://BlueLetterBible.com) to cross-reference my text with the original Hebrew to ensure a correct rendering.

Just a quick note about using an AI tool like ChatGPT for translation work: there are three big problems with translating large documents like the Bible: consistency, speed and personal bias. If you're translating manually, all three of these can become big hurdles to overcome. While I could have done a lot more of the translation work manually, by using AI tools, I was able to achieve a more consistent result, faster and with less personal bias.

What I can guarantee is that, as of the time that I make an official release, for every verse in the Bible, either I will have written it myself as an original translation, or I will have read and compared it against the original texts to ensure that it is valid and that it reads well in English.

### Why?

I can imagine that one of the first questions coming up regarding this project is "Why **yet another** English translation of the Bible? Aren't there already so many out there?"

Yes, there are a lot of English Bible translations already in existence. Many of them excellent. I read the Bible regularly, and often switch between various versions. As of the time I am writing this, some of those I refer to more frequently are BSB, CSB, ESV, and NASB.

And since I know Biblical Greek fairly well, as well as having a foundation in Biblical Hebrew, I often refer to the original languages.

While there are a lot of excellent Bible translations, I often find myself wondering why the translators translated particular passages how they did. For example, in King James, the last part of Revelation 12:17 reads "which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus." This is actually almost literally what the Greek passage says.

**Original Greek:**

    τῶν τηρούντων τὰς ἐντολὰς τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἐχόντων τὴν μαρτυρίαν τοῦ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ

**Literal word for word translation:**

    those keeping the commands/commandments of God and having the testimony of Jesus Christ

So in this case, KJV is actually pretty good. So why is it that so many modern translations try to screw this up and make this verse say something else, often having meanings that obscure the original passage?

While investigating this, and other, translation wording questions, I ran across a web site of a very popular, widely read modern English translation (which I will not name here). In it they published the notes and commentary of the translation committee, where they discussed why they translated particular verses the way they did. Most of the commentary was fairly innocent, but I did run across one rather strange comment concerning Luke 23:42. This is the famous verse where Jesus tells the thief on the cross that he will be in heaven:

**Original Greek:**

    καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς, Ἀμήν λέγω σοι σήμερον μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ ἔσῃ ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ

**Literal word for word translation:**

    and said to him Jesus, "Amen I say to you today with me you will be in paradise."

The comment by the translation committee was to the effect that they knew that they had translated it incorrectly when they wrote the text using the phrase "Amen I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise" because such a rendering contradicts the rest of the Bible narrative (including, for example, that Jesus didn't die that same day, and that when he was resurrected the following Sunday, he said that he hadn't yet gone to heaven; therefore either (a) Jesus was a liar when he told the thief he would se him that same day in heaven, or (b) Jesus didn't tell the thief he would see him that same day in heaven, but his words actually mean something else).

However, the translation committee also admitted why they rendered it incorrectly: ***because that's how everyone expects it***! In other words, instead of allowing the Bible to interpret itself, they shaped their translation to reflect what most people believe. In doing so, they failed in their mission to translate the Bible correctly.

Needless to say, I don't ever read that particular version any more. If they **deliberately mistranslated** that verse, then **what other verses did they screw up**?

For these, and other, personal, reasons ("Because I can!") I decided to make my own translation - to ensure I was reading a text that is fully consistent with the original text, and because sometimes I felt that I could do a better job. But mostly this was an exercise in getting to know the Bible better, because spending this much time looking so closely at each verse and its exact meaning, I gain a deeper appreciation and love for the Word of God.

### How?

When translating the Bible, there are a number of different philosophies that translators use to translate from one language to another. Some of the most prominent are termed "formal equivalence" and "dynamic equivalence".

Formal Equivalence can be thought of as "word for word" translation, while Dynamic (or Functional) Equivalence can be thought of as "thought for thought" translation.

Yes, it's true that there are very few Bible translations that are perfectly one type or the other: almost all are on a spectrum between the two.

Formal equivalence translations can be harder to read and understand since they focus more on the exact wording and ideas of the original text. Dynamic equivalence translations can be easier to read and understand since they focus more on rendering the ideas in a way that is understandable in the target language, but they can lose some of the original flavor and meaning of the original text and they very often depend on the biases and understanding of their interpreters.

Both translation methods are good. And, as far as the Bible is concerned, I strongly recommend that people use and read Bibles translated using both methods to get the best of both styles.

In recent years there has been a new, "hybrid" approach called "optimal equivalence" that has been used with some Bible translations, most notably the CSB (Christian Standard Bible), whose translators claim to have originated the term. The basic idea is to stick as closely as possible to formal equivalence (word for word), but use dynamic equivalence (idea for idea) where needed to make a passage as easy to understand as possible without straying from the original wording or meaning.

I particularly like this method since it uses a combined focus: original wording plus ease of understanding. Therefore, at the outset of my project I decided that I would use optimal equivalence as my underlying translation philosophy.

And thus, given the above discussion, I established as my overriding rules regarding my translation:

- Understanding the Word of God is the most important thing when reading the Bible, so above all else, the translation must be understandable, and it must be faithful to God's intent when He ispired the writers.
- I don't care how anyone believes, I want the text of my Bible to be as authentic as possible to the original text.
- I will use optimal equivalence as the guiding philosophy for translating from the original text into English.

### What?

In addition to HOW the Bible should be translated, there is also the question of WHAT to translate.

For translating from Hebrew, this question is actually quite easily answered, as there is one primary Hebrew text that scholars have agreed on, and used, for centuries: The Westminster Leningrad Codex, also referred to as Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS). This is the standard Hebrew text that pretty much everyone uses for Old Testament scholarship. And it is what I based my Old Testament translation upon.

For New Testament translation purposes, there is a bit more of a debate regarding which particular textual tradition to use, the two primary ones being Alexandrian and Byzantine. Not that there's that much of a difference between the two. In fact, there are no theological issues in any Christian denomination I am aware of that depend on the textual differences between these two New Testament textual traditions.

My own personal opinion is that the Alexandrian text-type tradition is more likely to be closer to the original text, but I don't categorically claim that as a dogmatic fact. I wasn't there, so I don't know for sure. I have investigated this matter in depth and, while I don't believe that there is enough evidence to conclusively say either way, my understanding of the evidence is that it leans more towards the Alexandrian texts as being closer to the original texts.

If you believe that the Byzantine text-type tradition is more original, good for you. You might be right. And I respect your opinion.

Because of my own personal leaning towards the Alexandrian tradition, I chose the UBS text as my source for translating the New Textament.

Regarding AI tools, my first attempts to use AI tools to translate the Bible were very inconsistent and it took a lot of experimentation with prompts before I was able to achieve consistent results.

For those who are interested in making a similar AI-assisted Bible translation into whatever language, here is a prompt that I used a lot to make rough drafts of entire chapters:

```
Translate Ephesians 5 into college-level English from UBS using optimal equivalence using the following non-negotiable rules:

Where appropriate, if a verse is formatted in poetic manner, then format the lines in that verse using the traditional poetic line breaks inside verses.
Put an extra line with an X between verses in the common places where paragraph-level breaks occur.
No summaries
No original text
No chapter numbers
YES, include verse numbers at the beginning of each verse and it is critical to not put a line break after the verse numbers.
No inclusive language like "people" instead of man, or "brothers and sisters" instead of "brothers".
No text formatting (bold, italics, superscript, etc.).
No bold formatting for verse numbers.
Use all caps LORD for the Tetragrammaton.
Use "the grave" for sheol.
Do not include any text except the translated text.
Do not include a header.
Do not include a footer.
Do not include references.
Avoid the word "behold" replacing it with something more understandable, or dropping it where appropriate
```

Obviously, it is necessary to change "UBS" to "BHS" for Old Testament chapters, but the above prompt works pretty well for both Old and New Testament passages.

## When?

I had started some of my earliest translations as early as 1992 and had mostly completed the gospels of John and Matthew and various other disconnected passages by late 2024. Most of my translation work occurred between January and November of 2025. Reviewing and editing has proceeded since then.

## Change History

- **2025-Nov-21** First upload. This has not been fully edited and it is still a raw first draft.
- **2025-Dec-14** I've reformatted all the book files to Markdown. Still a lot of editing work to do.
- **2025-Dec-16** More reformatting, edited a few verses. Still getting things organized.
- **2025-Dec-19** Made edits to Nehemiah, Proverbs, Psalms and Revelation plus a few miscellaneous edits.

Sample Text:

# Genesis

## Chapter 1

**<sup>1</sup>** In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. **<sup>2</sup>** Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

**<sup>3</sup>** Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. **<sup>4</sup>** And God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness. **<sup>5</sup>** God called the light "day," and the darkness He called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.

# Psalms

## Chapter 1

**<sup>1</sup>** Blessed is the man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor stand in the way of sinners,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor sit in the seat of scoffers.<br/>
**<sup>2</sup>** But his delight is in the law of the Lord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on His law he meditates day and night.<br/>
**<sup>3</sup>** He is like a tree planted by streams of water,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which produces fruit in due season,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its leaf does not wither;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he prospers in all that he does.

**<sup>4</sup>** The wicked are not so,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rather, they are like chaff driven away by the wind.<br/>
**<sup>5</sup>** Therefore the wicked will not stand on the day of judgment,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<br/>
**<sup>6</sup>** For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the path of the wicked will fail.
