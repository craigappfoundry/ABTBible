# ABT Bible Translation

This is my own personal Bible Translation. Feel free to download and read and comment.

- **2025-Nov-21** First upload. This has not been fully edited and it is still a raw first draft.
- **2025-Dec-14** I've reformatted all the book files to Markdown. Still a lot of editing work to do.
- **2025-Dec-16** More reformatting, edited a few verses. Still getting things organized.

Sample Text:

# Genesis

## Chapter 1

<sup>**1**</sup> In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. <sup>**2**</sup> Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

<sup>**3**</sup> Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. <sup>**4**</sup> And God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness. <sup>**5**</sup> God called the light "day," and the darkness He called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.

# Psalms

## Chapter 1

<sup>**1**</sup> Blessed is the man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor stand in the way of sinners,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor sit in the seat of scoffers.<br/>
<sup>**2**</sup> But his delight is in the law of the Lord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on His law he meditates day and night.<br/>
<sup>**3**</sup> He is like a tree planted by streams of water,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which produces fruit in due season,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its leaf does not wither;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he prospers in all that he does.

<sup>**4**</sup> The wicked are not so,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rather, they are like chaff driven away by the wind.<br/>
<sup>**5**</sup> Therefore the wicked will not stand on the day of judgment,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

<sup>**6**</sup> For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the path of the wicked will fail.
