# ABT Bible Translation

This is my own personal Bible Translation. Feel free to download and read and comment.

- **2025-Nov-21** First upload. This has not been fully edited and it is still a raw first draft.
- **2025-Dec-14** I've reformatted all the book files to Markdown. Still a lot of editing work to do.
- **2025-Dec-16** More reformatting, edited a few verses. Still getting things organized.

Sample Text:

# Genesis

## Chapter 1

[1] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. [2] Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

[3] Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. [4] And God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness. [5] God called the light "day," and the darkness He called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.

# Psalms

## Chapter 1

[1] > Blessed is the man
    > who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,
    > nor stand in the way of sinners,
    > nor sit in the seat of scoffers.
[2] > But his delight is in the law of the Lord,
    > and on His law he meditates day and night.
[3] > He is like a tree planted by streams of water,
    > which produces fruit in due season,
    > its leaf does not wither;
    > and he prospers in all that he does.

[4] > The wicked are not so,
    > rather, they are like chaff driven away by the wind.
[5] > Therefore the wicked will not stand on the day of judgment,
    > nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
[6] > For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,
    > but the path of the wicked will fail.
